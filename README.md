# StrangersOnYoutube
Usage: 

- to obtain data (using your Google API key!) and your Youtube video of choice, change the link and the Google API key when running the notebook data_retrieval_and_cleaning.ipynb.
- to make a sample for human annotation of the semantic analysis (for whatever purposes; I recommend making a small dataset of groundtruth and using it to evaluate other NLP models under comments of your choice) run basic_sentiment_analysis.ipnyb
- to annotate comments that come from any csv file named 'sample_for_groundtruth.csv' and has columns named 'Unnamed: 0' representing users' ID and 'Comments' representing users' comments, the last cell of the previous script. You cannot do this unless you have ran the other two scripts or you change some of the input files.
