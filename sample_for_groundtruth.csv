877,You‚Äôre disturbing. Get help.
9435,I‚Äôve always loved Colleen and always will ‚ù§
7618,Yikes.
8781,I had a really hard time lately not being able to watch new videos for you. And I‚Äôve been so worried about you. But this made me so happy to see/hear. You did an apology in a true Colleen fashion and I loved. Kept being you and don‚Äôt let people bring you down‚ù§
5011,"girl you really thought you ate, huh? üò≠"
3709,Responding to very serious accusations (that have a lot of evidence to back them up) with a song is the most tone deaf thing I‚Äôve ever seen
5037,In what universe is this ‚Äútaking accountability‚Äù? You called everyone calling you out liars even though there‚Äôs an avalanche of screenshots and videos.
7736,"I'm not sure how I feel, not sure singing and not really apologizing was the way to go. But I'm glad to see you here, I've missed you and I hope you are okay."
502,No bc she is actually making a point and you people are saying it is cringy when she's trying to apologize even tho she did nothing wrong
8902,literally what is this
6832,"Whoa, thousands of people against one, very mature ‚Ä¶"
2176,"This is unreal, like just excuses and saying nothing is true, and to sing on top of that, so fucking insulting to everyone she harmed"
461,Why‚Äôd everyone just start coming at her üò™ but I love her singing voice tho it‚Äôs actually good üò∫
8190,This is the best!! I love it!
3485,"Happy to see you, seriously. Those who have been following you for many years know what growth and change looks like. We miss you."
4123,Worse way you couldve responded maybe next time ACTUALLY take accountability fr pathetic
4489,IS SHE SERIOUS??????
2807,HELLO?
4010,"You do realise you‚Äôre talking about kids here, right? Kids that are traumatised? I have always supported you, but this is wild. It just comes across as so disconnected and remorseless."
4316,We ain‚Äôt getting out of the hood with this one!!
1536,"You're SO creepy, omg."
2006,Her PR team should be fired immediately for this lol
9011,I love you so much I missed you ‚ù§
5523,You made this video to throw a pity party for yourself. Take some damn responsibility.
38,"I've been watching colleen and stopped but still sometimes watched her videos but if you people actually watched colleen and Miranda yall would know colleen anit like that cause now the Genz is so sensitive and snowflakes because 1 person did a mistake and all these things were back then in the 2010's and the humor and status were different then like people could take jokes and the thing with Adam if u watched the stream he SPECIFICALLY asked for the panties because she was unboxing random things and was giving it away and with the girl who was ""exposed"" on stage she wanted to get called up for the corn challenge but got called up for yoga and she could've denied it and didn't go up but she did so its basically her fault for going on stage knowing her outfit was revealing and with the kid and cheeseballs he could've said he didn't but that was all an innocent act u can hear the parents and children laughing in the crowd so all this is absolutely bogus because when something comes out and you realize colleen was right and innocent yall gonna look real dumb and if those people were victim's I'm sorry but everyone should not be jumping on colleen like this cause yall loved her and now all of sudden hate her make it make sense because if you were a fan you'd defend her and not accuse her so what is this like all these people are so invested in someone else's life and making a big deal out of it and now that technology is advanced there's things that can be fake and generated so yall shouldn't be riding colleen like its the toxic gossip train so yall really need to calm down with all this she made an apology and you guys are upset about it this is wildddd"
129,just leave her alone. you guys are getting over something from so long ago that she didn‚Äôt do anything
9870,I know this must be so hard ‚ù§ stay strong!
7270,Girl‚Ä¶

5810,It's so disappointing and so disheartening
4292,is she serious? oml
753,Guys she made a video taking accountability when this was brought up YEARS AGO.
7898,victimising yourself üò¢
2407,A YouTube apology song with a ukulele was not on my 2023 bingo card.
3342,wow. somehow an even worse response than i imagined.
1260,I have the urge to throw fruit at her
2127,pack it up bro it's over...
9852,oh
503,"This is tragic on both sides. Fans who got hurt and a performer who was monetized on YouTube and sold tickets with all these stage performances recorded and never said anything about it until now and the very thing ppl were entertained by is now evidence against them.. what does that make ppl who paid to  watch it, volunteered to be on stage? The whole thing is twisted on every side and sad and even worse forever connected to her name for her kids to see later.  Humans are a complicated creature and fame is fickle..  u can be entertainment until later its decided its perverse... I hope everyone can find healing on both sides eventually"
2867,ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
2204,"Colleen, I wish I could give you a great big hug!  People love to twist stuff so they can point and jeer and act like they've never done something that they've come to regret.  I NEVER post but I just felt like I had to say something.  You are a great entertainer, a wonderful mom and an all around great girl.  Don't let 'em get ya down!  Terri"
8556,I have never clicked on a notification so quick! Your true fans are still here and we love you! So happy to see you are ok. You got this girl! Don't let the haters get you down ‚ù§
6427,There is absolutely no way you thought this would be a good idea? Seriously?
9381,"I hope you‚Äôre well, please take care‚ú®‚ù§Ô∏è"
8164,I have support you for a long time
1736,A‚Ä¶‚Ä¶SONG????
7046,this is the worst possible way you could‚Äôve responded to this situation what is wrong with you
9618,"girl you‚Äôre joking‚Ä¶where in this did you take accountability? all i hear is a shitty song defending yourself and not apologizing to anyone or owning up for what you did!!! and it wasn‚Äôt about the fart joke, you know this. i thought you were smarter than this, but i guess not. my disappointment is immense. goodbye, colleen."
9230,Just wanted to tell you that I love you.
1697,colleen‚Ä¶ girl bfr

5516,This is awful..... the downward spiral continues.
3408,she really said ‚Äúi‚Äôm winning this idgaf war‚Äù
7475,"Y'all need to calm down and take a moment to think about your own lives. I'm sure every person watching this has done cringy things, and realized later, I know I have. That's life, if your not making mistakes how can you learn? Colleen is doing the best she can just like the majority of you all. Keep your head up Colleen and focus on your family and kids."
7094,"Colleen come back , this cancel culture is getting out of hands , They are accusing you of things that happened many years ago .they literally do not have a life or a job so they waste their time and energy in finding the mistakes of celebrities that happens centuries ago."
2922,what the hell
1451,No this is actually so bad why would she do this üò≠üò≠
1053,Is this a fucking joke

295,"I like this song, I find myself singing it"
8903,So what's your justification for sending a MINOR Trisha Paytas' adult content? That's a crime. People supporting you are just as bad.

9092,"Even tho I do think ppl have been blowing your past mistakes out of proportion, I‚Äôm worried releasing a song about it will only makes things worse and lead to more ppl mocking you‚Ä¶idk tho it‚Äôs sort of a lose lose situation so maybe it doesn‚Äôt matter, but I would recommend releasing a more serious video addressing each point and clarifying what the lies are."
6558,"May God bless you and your beautiful family, sadly this is the price for fame, people will turn their back on you but God is always with you and willing to heal a broken heart, God is not religion, God is peace and love, God doesn‚Äôt judge you God forgives us all we all should learn from him, just know that God is not far way he is in front of you and loves you more than you can even imagine!"
1286,This is not the time to joke.
2263,Don't listen to the internet troll. They are just being mean . Its aweful seeing people attacking you like that you deserve better.
9079,Cancel culture is out of control.
79,Love you Colleen ‚ù§Ô∏è
3533,you handled this like a 2016 influencer. Completely out of touch and missing the point.
153,"i love u and i will always will‚ù§ u shouldnt have to apologize again, your amazing im sorry ur going through this again bb, u dont deserve this"
2425,Steven Universe after he curb stomps a baby
1531,this is a really bizarre apology‚Ä¶ everything is a disingenuous performance for her. ick.
8131,"Y‚Äôall really think she‚Äôs into kids‚Ä¶ like EVERYTHING aside, bffr ‚ò†Ô∏è"
8562,"I watched for 48 seconds and then realized you weren‚Äôt going to be accountable for anything you‚Äôve said or done to these children. You should be ashamed of yourself not only as a creator, but as a mother. An emotionally intelligent person would know the severity of the claims, and would know better then to make a fucking song out of it."
58,Since I‚Äôm with God I‚Äôma forgive uüíï

I was full of so much excitement when I saw that you posted this video. You keep fighting for what‚Äôs right and the people that know the truth will always be here to support you! üíï"
1162,"This is actually hilarious, responding to screenshots of you being inappropriate with fans and multiple testimonies with a UKULELE SONG???"
3730,the shittiest apologize to ever exist. <br><br>Tanas was way better
4210,"Hi Colleen, I really hope you see this comment! I've been a supporter for so many years and will continue to support you Colleen :) It's just that maybe a song wasn't the best way to come out about this topic.

2437,"What a slap in the face for the CHILDREN who felt victimized/uncomfortable/confused/manipulated. Is this what you feel they‚Äôre worth? A song? There‚Äôs something so bizarre about this continuation of this narrative that you don‚Äôt truly understand how your lack of boundaries can deeply affect the CHILDREN you targeted (because you DID target them, it‚Äôs how you made a name for yourself). So off."
3504,We need an apology on his god awful song alone
267,"Colleen, I'm so sorry you're going through this. I know people are going to think you're mocking, but I see the pain in your face and your voice. You know you can't convince anybody so you do what you do best during a hard time. I'm still standing by you as a 33 year old mama who has always loved COLLEEN! I was never here for miranda, always you!"
8266,You are a beautiful human! And I‚Äôm so sorry accusations have been thrown around. Hug those babies and Erik during this time even more. I‚Äôm a fan and will remain a fan ‚ù§

5683,the tampon thing was weird tho
6905,"This is disgusting- the only facts are the people you hurt. Excusing how you made others feel with your narcissistic song just showed your true colors.

I have followed you for years, im so disappointed"

4903,girlie you did not
5535,HELPPPP
3780,"I‚Äôm not usually someone that comments on anyone‚Äôs videos but I have been watching your videos for years and I will never doubt you! Yes we all make mistakes, but we are all human!  All of these people in the comments need to grow up and focus on their own lives instead of being a keyboard warrior and destroying someone‚Äôs life for a mistake that happened in the past! We‚Äôre supposed to grow from our mistakes, they make us better people for it, we‚Äôre not supposed to be completely ripped apart! I don‚Äôt doubt that every single person that has commented negatively on this video has made a mistake, what makes them different from Colleen? Just because they don‚Äôt have a public platform to be dragged down like everyone is doing to Colleen?? You all need to grow up and focus on yourselves!"

4353,girl what
9282,"I‚Äôm so glad your back, I‚Äôve missed you so much. The internet these days can be harsh. Even though you did some wrong things you didn‚Äôt deserved to be called such hateful things.

409,what she did was not ok but maybe the only way she can apologize is through music. so instead of being mad at the apologized through a ukulele be grateful that she apologize at all
542,<3
4804,A song? ‚Ä¶.
3990,did anyone else actually find the song very catchy and want more
1468,You thought u ate
8565,I am glad you found a loophole to ta‚Ä¶sing to us. Nice to see your dance and I hope this is a welcome back. I am only partway through the video.
8216,Is this a fucking joke to you?!????
5061,Sicko.
6704,"Colleen, I have been watching you for years and I know you are a good person. I've never lost faith in you or your work and I hope these haters do not burn it all down. Stay strong friend, I believe in you!"

4090,This is the most Rachel Berry ass thing I‚Äôve ever seen (derogatory)
6146,There‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm going to judge a person by their pass. It matters what‚Äôs in your heart right now and right now you‚Äôre a beautiful person. People are just jealous of your success and how great of a person you are. i‚Äôve watched you for a really long time and all your videos bring me joy. From your Miranda days to your Collabs to your pregnancy video and your daily blogs. Thank you for all you do for who you are for what you stand for right now.

7020,"I‚Äôm so sorry about all of this colleen! When I started hearing about any of this I immediately hated all of it. Why just people bring up the past but spin stuff around it to make you look like a bad person. You‚Äôre not a bad person, and the fact that people find entertainment in your pain not even thinking about how you‚Äôd feel. Disgusting. I hope you‚Äôre doing alright, I‚Äôve missed you and your fun family. But taking the time to make sure you‚Äôre mentally ok is what‚Äôs important. I hope you‚Äôre all ok and I can‚Äôt wait to see you again once you‚Äôre feeling up for it üíúüíúüíúüíú"

6845,"As someone who has been a fan for years and is only now growing to realize the wrongs you‚Äôve done, all I would want is you to stop inviting children up on stage.

7814,So happy to see you again Colleen!!!! üíõ
1730,wow this is an all new level and basically takes away any actual apology you previously issued after all the stuff that is coming out I can not offing believe this. I have been a regular commenter I have even gotten comments back from you Colleen I have loved your videos. this one though......I'm honestly ashamed and I am now unsubbing
4166,should‚Äôve stayed in the drafts
5161,Wow this is super mature. üôÑ And it wasn‚Äôt just one mistake. It was multiple mistakes over a very long time. Maybe it‚Äôs time to move on to a new career‚Ä¶.
7664,This idiot thinks she‚Äôs in a musical ü§£ take accountability weirdo . There‚Äôs receipts of your actions. A simple ‚Äúim sorry‚Äù was all you have to do

4067,"Colleen, I know you are a great person and that you didn‚Äôt mean anything bad. You only wanted to be nice to your followers.

4639,what happened to shame
151,"This is like the weirdest thing to care about, you guys. I believe her, but still, I DON‚ÄôT CARE! So over people thinking they‚Äôre social justice warriors on the phone. If she did something that warrants jail time, then that would be brought out in a trial. You think the Hollywood elites are trying to protect f**king Colleen Ballinger?! (Sorry Coll, love you)‚Ä¶but like for REAL?! Leave her alone. This is so inconsequential."
2563,"You could‚Äôve said, or done, literally anything and people would‚Äôve immediately jumped down your throat. Like you said, it‚Äôs not going to change anyone‚Äôs mind. At least those of us who still haven‚Äôt jumped on the cancel bandwagon were able to hear your viewpoint."
6525,So... taking advantage of fans so you can get free and cheap labor is not manipulation?
5843,did u rlly have to do a corny ass song though like be fr

7192,I‚Äôm so glad to see you! I could feel this to my core. I‚Äôve missed you. And I‚Äôve always always respected how you continue to learn and grow. The true followers know you aren‚Äôt perfect and love you because of that. Because you are human and we can see the intent and the good kind person in you. You are so freaking strong.

562,"At the very beginning of collen's yt career, she has been sharing with us how introvert, shy,loner  little girl or even up to now she is. This yt thing and popularity is not even her intention why she is making yt videos up until now. So if we come and think of it, she is not used to having a lot of attention from anyone. We should all be understanding and give everyone a chance to grow from their mistakes. Our generation is far different from their's, it is nice to see that young people are making a change, but we should not shame anyone for making something wrong especially if it's the past and that person is trying to have a life and change for the better."

3639,Holy shit no way this is real üòÖ
1378,The video is more weird with the song ‚Ä¶

7693,"You barely addressed anything let alone the screen shots which I think the majority of people wanted you to do, this is so bad that I don't even think you could count it as an ""apology"" please seek professional help"

5876,"I really feel like this isn't the way to go about this. We've all seen the messages, we've seen the videos from the shows, we've heard from your fans and what has happened to them. Taking accountability is necessary here. You can still hurt people no matter what your intentions are. This is a mockery of the people who you have hurt. Your intentions in this video is very self serving ""I won't survive in the crash"" instead of ""I'm sorry for the bad things I've done and the people I've hurt"".... see the difference?"

1295,"You haven't addressed the people you hurt and used. You have added streamers and smears of lipstick to <b>serious</b> allegations. <br>Spreading a teen's legs is <b>automatically</b> sus, regardless of context.<br>You need to learn to be objective instead of reactive to criticism. <br>Because if you can't, I have a pretty good idea what  diagnoses might suit you..."
6069,MY QUEEN!!!!
7791,Absolutely not.<br>You literally caused people so much pain and you come on here with a damn song‚Ä¶<br><br>No.

1094,How passive aggressive can one person be?  Grow up!  You are an awful person and are still blaming the people you hurt!!!
2557,girl shut up. you were predatory. they were victims. minimizing their experiences won‚Äôt get you far.
8926,WE LOVE YOU

7940,i can‚Äôt believe you‚Äôre fooling all of these people in the comments AGAIN. you‚Äôre genuinely not a good person

2058,absolutely REPULSIVE
8682,"Perfect response!!!  Come on back to us, it's where you belong. This too shall pass."
9527,I love you
8684,"Let's normalize celebrities defending themselves instead of doing what cancel culture  wants them to do and completely disappear üëèüëè she's allowed to be angry about millions of people lying, you would be angry too!!!"
8410,üíìüíì
1677,Did she literally filter his name out of the comments? I haven‚Äôt seen it once??
8308,This is so out of touch. You have caused irreparable damage and harm to a vast amount of people. And instead of acknowledging this and owning up (because there is literally proof) you‚Äôre singing?? Unbelievable
8785,colleen please be so fucking for real
6982,girl what is this
4607,You are out of your mind for posting this
2243,she‚Äôs officially lost her mind
6589,I kinda like it üôä
6371,So you're going to try and Zoey Deschanel/quirky girl your way out of this?
6104,So proud of you! ‚ù§Ô∏è
6611,oh i‚Äôve been waiting for this oneüòèü§£
9616,i love you so moch
5668,"Theres plenty of people (aside from youtubers as well) who have changed from their pasts, and become better people, thats how we grow as humans. But most of if not all of them apologize authentically with statements whether it be in person or online. I appreciate the idea behind this personally, as a commentary on apology videos as well, but with so many screenshots and reciepts I think you need to do more than just this. People were really hurt, Colleen. I‚Äôm writing this as a previous fan, and person who always looks to kindness and positivity. I think most people know that Miranda is PG-13, but still most of the fans of Miranda are children so it‚Äôs not fair to them to be put in situations they don‚Äôt understand but adults do. I hope you read this specific comment from a place of caring and love, because as a previous fan I do care about you as a human being. We all make mistakes, but to grow you have to embrace the mistakes. Certain things need to be addressed not defensed. (Also why was this not posted on the main channel?)"
608,"Colleen, it is important to grow from your mistakes from your past. Although everyone makes mistakes, it is important to take accountability with responsibility. Everyone does things wrong, life goes astray, but you owning up to your mistakes and growing from them is very important. You did just that. Please don't let the unencouraging comments get to you. ‚ù§"
9188,This isn‚Äôt how I expected you to come back but I‚Äôm so glad it is. Some of us still really love you and support you.‚ù§
5567,Omg D:
1182,Well this is the most delusional video I have ever seen. Just do absolutely anything so you don't take accountability I guess. You're such a quirky gatekeep gaslight girl boss with your random song. Imagine writing this song because you got caught out bullying teenagers and being inappropriate.. I can't..
143,"Everyone needs to sit down and take a second. If she would have sat there and made like a 25min video apologizing, you guys would call her a liar, say you don't care and say ""she's only responding because she got caught"". If she never responded, you guys would say she's guilty. If she completely stuck up for herself, you guys would also say she's a liar and say that you've already seen the facts. So now she gives you a response, not meant as an apology, just kind of saying ""don't believe everything you see"" because guess what, there's two sides to everything. I have been a fan for years, and yes what I have seen is really sickening and it makes me really sad, but I'm not going to bash her before I've even heard her side. This whole cancel culture shit is really fucking annoying, I swear people aren't even fans of her and are bashing on her. Chill tf out."
1005,This isn‚Äôt the one babe
8524,I‚Äôve missed you and have been really worried about you! So glad to see your face again.
5290,"this is the most unhinged thing i think ive ever seen surface youtube, worse than dramageddon. what the hell is going onüò≠"
9781,thank you for speaking out. i love you! üíï
1144,Womp womp
5099,u cant even sing girl
7000,I love u Colleen ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
8701,"Colleen the people that know and love you and your family are here for you , keep your chin up things will fix themselves out ‚ù§"
955,did she even say sorry? or like... she says mistake singular
7397,Comments criticizing you are hidden
4032,"Woop i'm so out of the loop with the whole Colleen hoover is bad thing, but this is truly one of the most tone deaf responses I have EVER seen"
5120,oh girl this is not it‚Ä¶.
2802,"I agree with her, all the fans are weirdos and love to crucify someone for their past. You know damn well she wasn‚Äôt trying to do anything inappropriate with her fans. You just want a reason to be mad at someone."
7388,This is a wild thing for a grown adult to post.
7773,I‚Äôm so proud of you colleen ü§é
5078,Yikes
3188,üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ
5722,if you don't put that damn ukulele down
973,"i hated this, surely it has to be a bit"
1072,Girl‚Ä¶ no.
7002,"Oh you sweet thing. I am tearing up watching this. Im so sorry this is happening to you.  As someone who has made a serious mistake in my life, I know how it can feel. I cannot even imagine being in the public eye. Please stay strong.  You, your kids, your husband all know your a wonderful person/mom/wife and thats all that matters."
4081,You almost have to admire her utter audacity pulling such a ludicrous stunt like this to absolve herself of blame for her crimes involving literal children
1740,Probably not the best choice to do an apology video.
5018,HAHAHAHHA
9306,I love you Colleen I‚Äôve been a fan for a long time just keep your head up the real ones will always stick up for you your sweet person who doesn‚Äôt deserve this i stand with you üíïit‚Äôs going to be ok even tho it probably doesn‚Äôt seem like it rn

2648,Girl put that guitar down
9009,f*** you for this seriously
7364,"Hi Colleen! I don‚Äôt know to say. Other then there are still a bunch of us that still love you and are glad that one, your ok. And two, that you are taking responsibility for your actions. Everyone makes mistakes like that a lot. But I have seen more then that over the years. I‚Äôve seen you love, laugh, and be your TRUE self around others. Including us. üòå. Not only that. But also saw you become a mom and teach THREE new kids about the world around them, and I can‚Äôt think of anyone else with that many and that young if kids that‚Äôs doing as good as you! You created the phase ‚ÄúHaters Back Off‚Äù and are sticking with it! And we love you for that. Some people never change or give up or anything! Your one of those people colleen üòòüòå<br><br><br>I know you did not have bad intentions. But saying your sorry is the best you can do. And because your doing that, and having the gut to do it now on the internet no doubt. That‚Äôs a true queen!"
4058,"Maybe she can‚Äôt talk details for legal reasons, but she keeps mentioning the facts, so what are the facts? Tell us how the evidence and receipts are wrong. Go ahead. Because right now not being able to prove that these so called ‚Äúfacts‚Äù aren‚Äôt being listened to or taken into consideration is making the situation look even worse. Idk how one looks at damning evidence and goes that‚Äôs not right, then refuses to elaborate how. I just want everything out in the open."
6381,nah i‚Äôm cackling wtaf this is WILDDDDDDDDDSS
7335,Shameful
8539,"It‚Äôs important to think, Do you judge someone by the worst thing they do or the best thing they do?"
5665,"when the red flags wave themselves, believe them. üö©you should have put the ukulele away and listened to your team."
6250,Colleen really? You‚Äôre right btw‚Ä¶. This is disappointing üòë
6267,girl what üò≠
3903,This is actually comical
5448,what the literal fuck
1068,I don‚Äôt recognize you in this video :/
2441,no way this is real üò≠
2572,"go girl, ignore the comments like you ignored the rolling stone article"
7847,saw you last week in indy and will continue to send you love and support. we all make mistakes and we have to learn and grow for them! the bandwagons of hatred and misinformation people jump on are hideously alarming. thank you for finally talking about this! ‚ù§ you deserve to be heard and have your apology listened to and accepted!
5169,This will go down in YouTube history
1492,This cannot be serious
6092,This is almost as bad as when sienna Mae responded to serious allegations with a dance video üíÄüíÄ
3070,This wasn't it. This isn't taking accountability. This resolves nothing.
2722,Is all true tho mate
9672,Happy you are getting through this!! Have been watching you for YEAAARSSSS and I know you are a good person
2363,I‚Äôm sad this is happening many years after it happened. (B4 y‚Äôall come for me Trisha to me is way worse)
7280,I‚Äôd delete this if I were you
9825,Umm
867,"oh my fucking god.<br>two fucking weeks to have this as an ""apology""<br>fucking bullshit."
511,Colleen. I love you so much.<br>What you did was wrong BUT a you HAVE CHANGED!!<br>I‚Äôm Amman from your Thousand Oaks show.<br>You are amazing and I will always appreciate you.

4561,She's a mom! That's what baffles me
3544,oh that‚Äôs not-
6491,Does she not know what people are mad about?
9169,Maybe shouldn‚Äôt over share in the first place?
8660,Please come back to vlogging your real fans miss you!üòä
4586,This is baddddd
4614,"If someone took advantage of me then put THIS video out I would feel worse. I know everything happened a few years ago, some of it still ongoing at her shows but time doesn't heal wounds. Traumatic experiences stick in your brain forever but to make a song about how you're not sorry for what you did and not acknowledging you did something wrong is pathetic and like I said, revictimizing.<br><br> The good news is, she cant claim defamation because there are videos and text messages to prove it."
2191,how disappointing was this... wow
4307,NO WAY.
2991,"Are you freakin‚Äô kidding me? This is how you respond? Taking no accountability whatsoever, even with all the proof that‚Äôs been produced. Absolutely disgusted right now."

9570,"it feels weird not watching you almost everyday, it was something i always did- but i really hope you‚Äôre okay"
8871,I am a silent viewer and I just want to let you know that i have been logging on everyday to check if you have posted and i love you so much. I have made a mistake (as has everyone on the planet) so this doesn't change a single thing i think about you. All these lovely comments are people who care and support you <3
8001,"I hope we start to impose clear guidelines for influencers to protect them, and fans, from this in the future. Colleen and Jenna marbles... good souls and entertainers who grew up in the social media spotlight and were persecuted for their pasts. We sure do blur boundaries when influencers share their lives with us. Suddenly nothing is off-limits to fans."
54,thank you so much you are so brave
4084,I SAW IT ON TIKTOK I CANT BELIEVE ITS REAL
8816,I love you so much Colleen I don‚Äôt believe these rumors and I can‚Äôt believe people are being so rude to such a kind person like you‚ù§
2667,"oh god, I‚Äôm watching a dumpster fire"
6101,"I've been away from social media for a while, what happened exactly? I'm so confused..."
5426,Hang in there. Focus on you and your family.  You know what you need to work on as a person and that‚Äôs what matters. Not one person is perfect and the fact that they are all standing on a soap box acting like they are is ridiculous.

6801,I can't believe they're going on and trashing you for what past I don't believe everything I hear on YouTube
9830,First comment.
6245,NOT THE UKULELE ‚ò†Ô∏è
8603,"Sorry you have been hurt so badly, attacked and broken. Missed watching your videos...stay strong, you still have fans here for you"
5833,"You really woke up and thought this was a good idea, huh"
1467,this is not real LMFAOOOOO
2898,"10 minutes gone by, no ""sorry"" detected"

4582,what the fuck LMAOOO
9543,We love and missed you Colleen!
8525,"This is a perfect response. The internet is so extremist. You fucked up, you know that, you‚Äôve suffered consequences because of that.. done."
8166,‚ù§
2919,There's literally proof lol people are not making up rumors. You've behaved totally inappropriately towards underage fans. Time to throw in the towel and get a normal 9-5 job.
8067,The fact that this got almost 7k likes that means probably 7k people agree with her and stand with her
8880,Stay strong! I miss you !!!
5196,"Some ideas should stay like that, ideas. This ain't it... It isn't too late to private the video tho"
1010,omg this feels like the gabbi hanna thing all over again
7672,i love you. please don‚Äôt forget so many of us do and will support you forever.
7011,"Please don‚Äôt stop posting, sharing with us and pursuing your amazing career, Colleen. Every single human makes unintentional mistakes ALL THE TIME. You‚Äôre loved and trusted, and we need you here (as long as you want to be) ‚ù§"
4539,GIRL WHAT IS THIS üíÄ
4396,what the fuck
2215,"there‚Äôs actual evidence. texts, videos, AUDIO made by ur friend coryüò≠"
3797,You are seriously delusional if you think this is any kind of acceptable.
656,"I mean we all gotta calm down. She chose to expose herself but no one is perfect. I really think she‚Äôs changed, people change and try to be better. We should all try and be better than yesterday, seriously who are we to judge people by their past??"
5749,How much does this woman love the sound of her own voice? Height of narcissism.
2840,Oof.
5043,I feel such a responsibility to say that I believe you Colleen and I am so sorry you are having to go trough this. This situation is not fair to you and your family and it makes me feel so disappointed with this new generation of teens and young adults relying on cancel culture and making someone else's life difficult. I appreciate the creative way to decided to stand up for yourself and I admire the strength this videos probably took for you to make ‚ù§
3489,bro imagine if logan paul did this
86,I love you Colleen I‚Äôm sorry about this ‚ù§
10010,first
9202,I have been so worried about you. I know you aren‚Äôt doing good but know your fans are heartbroken for you! All the hugs in the world!
2736,dawg ‚ò†Ô∏è
5880,"People saying she needs to take accountability. What will taking accountability do exactly. People need to get a life and stop being toxic to everyone. If there are victims of any crime from anyone that has ever been 'cancelled'  they should go to the police if they think something really wrong has happened to them, or have had a crime committed against them. That's how people are held accountable. The mob baying for blood does not improve anyone's lives. The mob is not better than anyone."
9780,Hold Ur head up queen
2670,"Hey Colleen<br> I just wanted to let you know that as soon as I heard the rumours I acknowledged it was likely you made a mistake in the past (as you said people make mistakes) BUT I immediately decided based on the information out there and how you seem to live your life now (not that anyone really knows (which is part of the reason I feel like maybe they shouldn‚Äôt be so quick to judge‚Ä¶. Annnyway)) that you seem like you‚Äôve grown and moved on. Even if it was an unfortunate mistake that seemed to hurt people, if you choose to lean and grow and change the way you behave, in my personal opinion that‚Äôs enough to show you actually are remorseful of your behaviour and there is tons of room for forgiveness. Anyway just wanted to sound off for the people who didn‚Äôt jump on the train cuz they see a genuine caring woman in you and we‚Äôre standing with you the whole time üëç"
2487,"y‚Äôall she never said this was an apology video‚Ä¶ she is sticking up for herself. sure she made some mistakes, but that was a few years ago, it was addressed, she apologized, it should‚Äôve been over. now it‚Äôs being brought up again, and i definitely think this time it‚Äôs for clout. let her live her life."
4627,You‚Äôre delusional.
6185,We support you!! Stay Strong!!
1864,"If you were really ""apologizing"" then you‚Äôd put this on your main channel, not your vlog channel üòÇ"
845,Colleen you still have people that love you! Please know that! ‚ù§
6793,WHAT THE HELLüî• Creepy.
2965,"maybe don‚Äôt deny everything and move on, maybe talk about why they aren‚Äôt true. maybe we believe it because we haven‚Äôt heard any other reason, even now!!"
961,oh she‚Äôs done done now fr fr
889,Gabbie Hanna is that you?
7950,"Colleen we've never met in person but I got to know you through your videos and I consider you a friend. I just wanted to tell you that I am sorry for the why you've been treated recently. You don't deserve it. I know that it must be hard for you right now but please remember that there are a lot of people who care about you. I will be here once you are ready to go back to making videos, as I am sure a lot of other people will ‚ù§"
1121,I don‚Äôt like how she victimizes herself the whole song
