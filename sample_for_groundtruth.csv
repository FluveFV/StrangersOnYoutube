6811,GIRL REALLY?????
278,Idk what she did. But i forgive her.
3005,there’s literally no way this is real
394,"I vote this the BEST APOLOGY VIDEO of all time, this is a future Youtube CLASSIC in real time... <br>But i'm a sucker for musicals and i don't know what the fuck happened or care to find out beyond this video"
7021,new worst YouTube apology vid dropped. Laura lee could never
5081,I like your video Colleen
5708,you’re delusional
1006,Are you kidding me?!!
5171,WHAT IS HAPPENING BRO…? 😨
2137,What happened to crying in front of a camera
9303,I love you.
3956,"bet you didn't watch this back after you finish recording it, eh? girl, be fucking for real, no one told you this wasn't a good idea?"
1308,huhhhhhhh
2969,girl??
7294,not everyone believes these accusstions about you <3 you have people on your side that can see past the screenshots missing context
5585,Ok I’m 13 seconds in - is she taking the fucking piss 😅
3472,Omg please don’t sing please don’t sing 😆
2749,Holy shit.
1207,You have got to be kidding me.
9948,Omgshut up
5678,🫶🏻🫶🏻🫶🏻
7200,I respect her for this honestly
8038,Oh my god
2921,Girl my mind was never changed. I love you. You're incredible is so many ways. I'm so happy you have a wonderful family that will support your through all of this. I hope you'll be okay. I'm proud of you for not addressing all of this sensationalism. <b>snaps</b>
603,I love you.  What's going on sucks!
877,You’re disturbing. Get help.
9435,I’ve always loved Colleen and always will ❤
7618,Yikes.
8781,I had a really hard time lately not being able to watch new videos for you. And I’ve been so worried about you. But this made me so happy to see/hear. You did an apology in a true Colleen fashion and I loved. Kept being you and don’t let people bring you down❤
5011,"girl you really thought you ate, huh? 😭"
3709,Responding to very serious accusations (that have a lot of evidence to back them up) with a song is the most tone deaf thing I’ve ever seen
5037,In what universe is this “taking accountability”? You called everyone calling you out liars even though there’s an avalanche of screenshots and videos.
7736,"I'm not sure how I feel, not sure singing and not really apologizing was the way to go. But I'm glad to see you here, I've missed you and I hope you are okay."
502,No bc she is actually making a point and you people are saying it is cringy when she's trying to apologize even tho she did nothing wrong
8902,literally what is this
6832,"Whoa, thousands of people against one, very mature …"
2176,"This is unreal, like just excuses and saying nothing is true, and to sing on top of that, so fucking insulting to everyone she harmed"
461,Why’d everyone just start coming at her 😪 but I love her singing voice tho it’s actually good 😺
8190,This is the best!! I love it!
3485,"Happy to see you, seriously. Those who have been following you for many years know what growth and change looks like. We miss you."
4123,Worse way you couldve responded maybe next time ACTUALLY take accountability fr pathetic
4489,IS SHE SERIOUS??????
2807,HELLO?
4010,"You do realise you’re talking about kids here, right? Kids that are traumatised? I have always supported you, but this is wild. It just comes across as so disconnected and remorseless."
4316,We ain’t getting out of the hood with this one!!
1536,"You're SO creepy, omg."
2006,Her PR team should be fired immediately for this lol
9011,I love you so much I missed you ❤
5523,You made this video to throw a pity party for yourself. Take some damn responsibility.
38,"I've been watching colleen and stopped but still sometimes watched her videos but if you people actually watched colleen and Miranda yall would know colleen anit like that cause now the Genz is so sensitive and snowflakes because 1 person did a mistake and all these things were back then in the 2010's and the humor and status were different then like people could take jokes and the thing with Adam if u watched the stream he SPECIFICALLY asked for the panties because she was unboxing random things and was giving it away and with the girl who was ""exposed"" on stage she wanted to get called up for the corn challenge but got called up for yoga and she could've denied it and didn't go up but she did so its basically her fault for going on stage knowing her outfit was revealing and with the kid and cheeseballs he could've said he didn't but that was all an innocent act u can hear the parents and children laughing in the crowd so all this is absolutely bogus because when something comes out and you realize colleen was right and innocent yall gonna look real dumb and if those people were victim's I'm sorry but everyone should not be jumping on colleen like this cause yall loved her and now all of sudden hate her make it make sense because if you were a fan you'd defend her and not accuse her so what is this like all these people are so invested in someone else's life and making a big deal out of it and now that technology is advanced there's things that can be fake and generated so yall shouldn't be riding colleen like its the toxic gossip train so yall really need to calm down with all this she made an apology and you guys are upset about it this is wildddd"
129,just leave her alone. you guys are getting over something from so long ago that she didn’t do anything
9870,I know this must be so hard ❤ stay strong!
7270,Girl…
3977,oh…
6712,"From the true words of our beloved FASH ""forgetting to buy groceries is a mistake,this is BETRAYAL!!!"""
1179,and that’s what you missed on glee
8002,"Happy to see this. It was great to meet you on Saturday in Chicago & watch your show - so glad my mom & I were there! I'll never forget thanking you for sharing so openly about your pregnancies, as I am in week 23 of my first one. Excited to see you again in Ann Arbor in a few weeks!"
5729,“ Not based on facts” literally on video and record
670,I love you Colleen. I miss you videos I watched every single one since before Flynn was born. I hope you come back.
2495,"Imagine thinking this was a good idea. Oh no baby, what is you doing.."
1929,Is this real? Is this really happening?
5810,It's so disappointing and so disheartening
4292,is she serious? oml
753,Guys she made a video taking accountability when this was brought up YEARS AGO.
7898,victimising yourself 😢
2407,A YouTube apology song with a ukulele was not on my 2023 bingo card.
3342,wow. somehow an even worse response than i imagined.
1260,I have the urge to throw fruit at her
2127,pack it up bro it's over...
9852,oh
503,"This is tragic on both sides. Fans who got hurt and a performer who was monetized on YouTube and sold tickets with all these stage performances recorded and never said anything about it until now and the very thing ppl were entertained by is now evidence against them.. what does that make ppl who paid to  watch it, volunteered to be on stage? The whole thing is twisted on every side and sad and even worse forever connected to her name for her kids to see later.  Humans are a complicated creature and fame is fickle..  u can be entertainment until later its decided its perverse... I hope everyone can find healing on both sides eventually"
2867,🤦🏼‍♀️
2204,"Colleen, I wish I could give you a great big hug!  People love to twist stuff so they can point and jeer and act like they've never done something that they've come to regret.  I NEVER post but I just felt like I had to say something.  You are a great entertainer, a wonderful mom and an all around great girl.  Don't let 'em get ya down!  Terri"
8556,I have never clicked on a notification so quick! Your true fans are still here and we love you! So happy to see you are ok. You got this girl! Don't let the haters get you down ❤
6427,There is absolutely no way you thought this would be a good idea? Seriously?
9381,"I hope you’re well, please take care✨❤️"
8164,I have support you for a long time
1736,A……SONG????
7046,this is the worst possible way you could’ve responded to this situation what is wrong with you
9618,"girl you’re joking…where in this did you take accountability? all i hear is a shitty song defending yourself and not apologizing to anyone or owning up for what you did!!! and it wasn’t about the fart joke, you know this. i thought you were smarter than this, but i guess not. my disappointment is immense. goodbye, colleen."
9230,Just wanted to tell you that I love you.
1697,colleen… girl bfr
8204,I’m balling. I missed you Colleen. I am so sorry this is happening.
5516,This is awful..... the downward spiral continues.
3408,she really said “i’m winning this idgaf war”
7475,"Y'all need to calm down and take a moment to think about your own lives. I'm sure every person watching this has done cringy things, and realized later, I know I have. That's life, if your not making mistakes how can you learn? Colleen is doing the best she can just like the majority of you all. Keep your head up Colleen and focus on your family and kids."
7094,"Colleen come back , this cancel culture is getting out of hands , They are accusing you of things that happened many years ago .they literally do not have a life or a job so they waste their time and energy in finding the mistakes of celebrities that happens centuries ago."
2922,what the hell
1451,No this is actually so bad why would she do this 😭😭
1053,Is this a fucking joke
9802,Disappointed in you
2702,girl
2952,"What did she do, this just showed up to me"
3340,OH HELL NO
2457,❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
295,"I like this song, I find myself singing it"
8903,So what's your justification for sending a MINOR Trisha Paytas' adult content? That's a crime. People supporting you are just as bad.
533,2023 isn’t real
2891,Girl what
1316,oh jesus christ girl
2824,I can’t believe this is real
3099,THE UKULELE NO WAY
1951,There's evidence just go ahead and take accountability
8587,✨️Jumpscare✨️
9092,"Even tho I do think ppl have been blowing your past mistakes out of proportion, I’m worried releasing a song about it will only makes things worse and lead to more ppl mocking you…idk tho it’s sort of a lose lose situation so maybe it doesn’t matter, but I would recommend releasing a more serious video addressing each point and clarifying what the lies are."
6558,"May God bless you and your beautiful family, sadly this is the price for fame, people will turn their back on you but God is always with you and willing to heal a broken heart, God is not religion, God is peace and love, God doesn’t judge you God forgives us all we all should learn from him, just know that God is not far way he is in front of you and loves you more than you can even imagine!"
1286,This is not the time to joke.
2263,Don't listen to the internet troll. They are just being mean . Its aweful seeing people attacking you like that you deserve better.
9079,Cancel culture is out of control.
79,Love you Colleen ❤️
3533,you handled this like a 2016 influencer. Completely out of touch and missing the point.
153,"i love u and i will always will❤ u shouldnt have to apologize again, your amazing im sorry ur going through this again bb, u dont deserve this"
2425,Steven Universe after he curb stomps a baby
1531,this is a really bizarre apology… everything is a disingenuous performance for her. ick.
8131,"Y’all really think she’s into kids… like EVERYTHING aside, bffr ☠️"
8562,"I watched for 48 seconds and then realized you weren’t going to be accountable for anything you’ve said or done to these children. You should be ashamed of yourself not only as a creator, but as a mother. An emotionally intelligent person would know the severity of the claims, and would know better then to make a fucking song out of it."
58,Since I’m with God I’ma forgive u💕
9457,Oh no she’s breaking
1693,I CANT WITH THIS— ISNT SHE LIKE 30?
3034,What the hell LMFAOOAOAOAOAO
8706,"I’m here for you Colleen, I’ll always be on your side. I don’t care what everyone else is saying, I love you and support you no matter what. I was full of so much excitement when I saw that you posted this video. You keep fighting for what’s right and the people that know the truth will always be here to support you! 💕"
1162,"This is actually hilarious, responding to screenshots of you being inappropriate with fans and multiple testimonies with a UKULELE SONG???"
3730,the shittiest apologize to ever exist. <br><br>Tanas was way better
4210,"Hi Colleen, I really hope you see this comment! I've been a supporter for so many years and will continue to support you Colleen :) It's just that maybe a song wasn't the best way to come out about this topic. But, I really want to continue to see your daily vlogs 😊. Don't forget how amazing they were!!!"
4281,Missed you love you!
9773,Omggg I missed youuu ❤️
366,Missed you so much. I love you Colleen.🫶🏼
9930,I will always believe you Colleen
8768,I love you for your authenticity don’t let them win we love you mama ♥️♥️♥️♥️
766,PUT THE FUCKING UKELELE DOWNNNNNNN
7241,M'am... you're almost 40..
9284,❤
7410,"Keep strong my love, I never thought you where in the wrong what so ever ❤"
1615,no
1636,Girl you cannot be fr rn
1327,So bullying is fine when she does it? Making a horrible song ‘addressing’ (mocking) the situation. <br><br>I love how when she isn’t crying til Kingdom come for sympathy she is making these horrible songs? <br><br>Accountability or got called out?
962,I love you colleen always will 🫶❤️
6604,"I’ve missed you so much! Whoever is talking bad about you are horrible people. I miss you and  can’t wait until you are back posting again, but if you need space you should take it for sure. I hope you feel better soon and I’m so sorry people are so rude!"
2437,"What a slap in the face for the CHILDREN who felt victimized/uncomfortable/confused/manipulated. Is this what you feel they’re worth? A song? There’s something so bizarre about this continuation of this narrative that you don’t truly understand how your lack of boundaries can deeply affect the CHILDREN you targeted (because you DID target them, it’s how you made a name for yourself). So off."
3504,We need an apology on his god awful song alone
267,"Colleen, I'm so sorry you're going through this. I know people are going to think you're mocking, but I see the pain in your face and your voice. You know you can't convince anybody so you do what you do best during a hard time. I'm still standing by you as a 33 year old mama who has always loved COLLEEN! I was never here for miranda, always you!"
8266,You are a beautiful human! And I’m so sorry accusations have been thrown around. Hug those babies and Erik during this time even more. I’m a fan and will remain a fan ❤
7444,I’m sure the real victims ( not u lol) are not having fun
4930,Honestly I appreciate you taking a lesson from Trisha’s book and kill ‘em with IDGAF 🤪  but she does care and it’s unfair what’s happening! Keep being beautiful Coleen this I’ll all blow over ❤
6157,"There are screenshots and receipts, unaltered by AI or Photoshop. You are vermin"
1846,DID SHAWTY REALLY SING
4714,what the hell
3438,"The ultimate move, out-troll the trolls! She pulled the rug out from under all of them 😂 all hail Queen Colleen 👑"
4137,This is unhinged…
8178,I know how it feels to have a huge rumor about you going around and everyone is believing the lies being told about you so im sorry that this happened to you  because you made really bad decisions like EVERY SINGLE PERSON DOES.They add lies to the truth but trust they will get there karma.AMEN❤️
2066,Literally no accountability taken 😂
4105,she thinks she sienna mae. 💀
1815,How DISRESPECTFUL TO your VICTIMS
7146,"We know the real you Colleen, you know the real you. Love you Colleen ❤"
3030,"I’ve been a loyal fan for years but I’m sorry, this was wild! Comes across very out of touch with the reality and seriousness of the situation. Really disappointed."
5865,"oh it definitely wasn't just a ""fart joke"" babe"
9067,We love u.
6470,girl what. are you actually kidding me right now
7808,No
8522,this is why i love her. this is great!
7872,What the actual fuck is going on this is the weirdest fucking way to respond to what is happening.
7399,I fucking love this.
3104,This gave me chills 😞 I’m so sad
7155,Great job ignoring all the hard proof against you. Pathetic but I’m not surprised. You need to leave the internet
6408,omg.
3522,literally why would you do this i’m-
7282,Girl not the ukulele... They're gonna eat you alive. You should have listened to your team.
6830,there is no way this is fucking real. so disrespectful
2951,when i tell you i saw this on tiktok n i still didn’t believe you posted this. holy shit when i tell you my mouth DROPPED
6530,❤❤
2045,We love you so much Colleen!!!! Hope you’re doing okay❤
2128,is this even real
3564,Omg how is this real??
7546,She totally gaslights
3675,Also “monetise their lies” as though you’re not a family blogger monetising your children
5991,This just made it worse
3218,girl ……. Ew. Just ew.
1145,This is such a fucking unhinged way to “apologize”
1257,girl bffr
9336,I believe in you. I will always watch your videos.
3063,Apology video? Na Apology song (but this actually isn't either it's just a song about how hateful everyone has been to her)
9268,❤❤❤❤
724,"I support you Colleen, people do make mistakes"
8196,"I never comment but I feel like it’s important for you, Colleen, to know that there’s still people out there that can observe a situation from a neutral point of view, like I did and will not throw themselves at any occasion of insulting someone. You are so brave for posting this video. Love you"
1164,Ain’t no way this shit is real 😭😭😭💀💀💀
9821,We love you queen
9184,❤
8094,i really hope that you get what you actually deserve because its much worse than this :)
2230,BRO PULLED OUT THE UKULELE
1113,Are you deadass?
8530,A pity party for yourself rn? Really?
2586,LOOOOOL WHAT IS THIS 😭😭
539,"I reckon just go back to posting vlogs, those that will be there will be there."
4424,How could she frr think this would help her..?? 💀💀💀💀
9585,oh
4138,he didn’t sayyyyy i couldn’t siiiiinggggg 😍
5801,yikes
3596,Oh this is grim like ..why did you respond with a song
4706,💜
9895,Miss you ❤
8295,I really don’t understand. What she did wrong? 🤔
3945,Just call the people and apologize. This is weird.
8924,Colleen! Im happy you’re back! I want you to come back and daily vlog! We need you! 💗
110,Haters back off 👄
495,Imagine if all the energy and resources being used to cancel celebrities was used to make actual political change… 🤷🏻
5808,Oh wow you’re rotten
3879,Girl are u fucking serious right now
5683,the tampon thing was weird tho
6905,"This is disgusting- the only facts are the people you hurt. Excusing how you made others feel with your narcissistic song just showed your true colors. You’re entitled to feel however like the narcissist you are but you are not taking accountability and more importantly you are making all of this about YOURSELF. I have followed you for years, im so disappointed"
6438,They kindly let you know 3 years ago girly
351,"this is definitely an odd way of apologizing, but it seems genuine and i feel bad for her"
7170,girl be so fr....
4903,girlie you did not
5535,HELPPPP
3780,"I’m not usually someone that comments on anyone’s videos but I have been watching your videos for years and I will never doubt you! Yes we all make mistakes, but we are all human!  All of these people in the comments need to grow up and focus on their own lives instead of being a keyboard warrior and destroying someone’s life for a mistake that happened in the past! We’re supposed to grow from our mistakes, they make us better people for it, we’re not supposed to be completely ripped apart! I don’t doubt that every single person that has commented negatively on this video has made a mistake, what makes them different from Colleen? Just because they don’t have a public platform to be dragged down like everyone is doing to Colleen?? You all need to grow up and focus on yourselves!"
4865,HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
6066,"You harmed kids, cut the crap and take responsibility"
2162,AINT NO WAY THIS IS REAL
1417,This is psychotic 😭💀 I cannot believe this is for real
1713,i’m so disgusted omg
1368,This is horrendous.
4271,LMAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO.....
5542,"I'm honestly flabbergasted she left the comments turned on. Was she confident people would accept this ""apology""? This was so disrespectful to the victims."
4353,girl what
9282,"I’m so glad your back, I’ve missed you so much. The internet these days can be harsh. Even though you did some wrong things you didn’t deserved to be called such hateful things. I and many other here still love and support you. You made mistakes and apologized for them. Hope you and the kiddos are doing ok."
7716,This is amazing. Hi :). I miss u so much hope to see you back to normal soon!!
6076,QUEEN OF NOT GIVING A FCK
1776,This ain’t it girl…
1944,love you!!! Keep on keepin' on.
1592,i must be getting pranked rn
4291,You simply cannot make this shit up. Let’s not forget you made children put their hands down your PANTS in front of a live audience 😩
6121,"YESSS COLLEEEENNN! Missed you. This was buried years ago. People get bored and want to ruin the lives of others to hide what’s wrong with theirs. Thank you for all you do for childhood cancer, helping people through tough times by making us laugh, and everything you do behind the scenes. We miss you, your kids, ur husband, moose and Kory. Love u Colleen can’t wait to see what’s next for you ❤"
3481,I’m sorry what- how is this real?!?!?
543,"I LOVE IT!!!  She sang a giant goodbye ""eff you"" to people who are going after her!!!!  😆"
1571,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceKMnyMYIMo&t=1m23s"">1:23</a> i know her pr team is fuming right now"
409,what she did was not ok but maybe the only way she can apologize is through music. so instead of being mad at the apologized through a ukulele be grateful that she apologize at all
542,<3
4804,A song? ….
3990,did anyone else actually find the song very catchy and want more
1468,You thought u ate
8565,I am glad you found a loophole to ta…sing to us. Nice to see your dance and I hope this is a welcome back. I am only partway through the video.
8216,Is this a fucking joke to you?!????
5061,Sicko.
6704,"Colleen, I have been watching you for years and I know you are a good person. I've never lost faith in you or your work and I hope these haters do not burn it all down. Stay strong friend, I believe in you!"
7758,This is so disgusting and tone deaf
3488,im sorry she ate y’all up
6716,be so forreal right now. be sooooo forreal. this is not a genuine response. all the people wanted was a real response not this corny tongue and cheek response. you’re in your late 30s.
67,🥴
3556,Omg no girl just delete this before it gets WORSE
8910,wouldn’t have done this in song format if it were me ms. girl…
2233,What the actual fuck
2240,IM LAUGHING SO HARD LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOO SHE MADE A SONG I CANNNNNOOOOTTTTTT
2217,this video is my 13th reason
6127,She can’t be serious with A SONG????
9366,"I have been sooo worried about you, Colleen, I, myself, cannot jump on the toxic train of “cancellation”. That being said, I have missed you!!!! And your beautiful babies to learn from and help me teach my son things that I wouldn’t have even thought about! You are a smile throughout my day that I have missed tremendously!!! ❤❤❤❤❤❤"
5001,Big yikes
9416,WE BELIEVE YOU!! WE MISS YOU! I LOVE YOU!
1762,Such a Colleen thing to do 😅
9949,I love you Colleen! ❤❤❤❤
7236,YESS COLLEEN I LOVE YOU!!!! HATERS BACK OFF
9065,"I am so happy to see your face. I was so worried about you. Your real fans always supported you through this. I hope despite this, you will continue to do what you love regardless of what trolls on the internet have to say. We love you Colleen! ❤❤❤"
1472,DELETE THIS WHILE YOU CANNNNN LIKE WHATTTT
4090,This is the most Rachel Berry ass thing I’ve ever seen (derogatory)
6146,There’s no way I’m going to judge a person by their pass. It matters what’s in your heart right now and right now you’re a beautiful person. People are just jealous of your success and how great of a person you are. i’ve watched you for a really long time and all your videos bring me joy. From your Miranda days to your Collabs to your pregnancy video and your daily blogs. Thank you for all you do for who you are for what you stand for right now.
4842,Calling Ethan Klein plssss come back
7909,"Girl, this is not it"
3453,You should’ve just not posted anything. There are a lot of things coming out so where is the accountability here?
2924,you cannot be serious HAHAHAHAHAHA
7624,"Very well spoken…or should I say sang. So glad to see you, even with so much hurt on your face. There are so many who still support you & hope the best for you and your family! I hope you can find peace & forgive yourself. Those who know you know that nobody is beating you up worse than you…please be gentle and kind to yourself. When you are ready to come back, we will all be here for you! 🩵"
7285,🔥🔥🔥🔥
9557,so happy to see other positive comments ❤❤❤❤ thanks to those
2,You really can sing!!!
5371,LMFAOOOOOO
7020,"I’m so sorry about all of this colleen! When I started hearing about any of this I immediately hated all of it. Why just people bring up the past but spin stuff around it to make you look like a bad person. You’re not a bad person, and the fact that people find entertainment in your pain not even thinking about how you’d feel. Disgusting. I hope you’re doing alright, I’ve missed you and your fun family. But taking the time to make sure you’re mentally ok is what’s important. I hope you’re all ok and I can’t wait to see you again once you’re feeling up for it 💜💜💜💜"
8032,Ppl have nothing better to do like get over it Colleen is a kind person she didn't mean any harm with what she did
7845,You are an amazing person! Great inspiration for so many reasons! Miss your vlogs! Hope you are better! Love you and support you ❤
9629,this is hilarious
6610,how is it even possible to make something this grating
6845,"As someone who has been a fan for years and is only now growing to realize the wrongs you’ve done, all I would want is you to stop inviting children up on stage. You’ve already stopped messaging people and that’s a start, but I think the biggest issue right now is your stage interaction with young people. I love you."
6339,"This isn't it<br><br>""Ooops I groomed some kids but look I'm so cutsie!!"""
3374,this is so unserious

6891,Be so forreal girl
9410,I’ve thought about you daily❤❤
7777,i really miss you everyday mama ❤️
3735,is this your campaign to finally get that teen choice award for best comedian?! w/ this you could actually win bc this is top tier comedic at this point!🤩🤣
5926,it's over for you<br><br>ps you have aged horribly
7001,Girl thinks she’s the Dixie Chicks or something
5508,It's hard to argue with the screen shots. Those seem to be facts. I don't see how your song addresses the facts.
5713,good god
1052,aint no way
4315,GIRL WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG W U
6565,did u take accountability?
4872,The nerve....  Girl bye
6864,"Ma'am... lmao wtf is this. If this is all ""lies and rumours"", then where is your evidence to disprove the screenshots, etc?"
314,ok why this lowkey ate…
9964,First
8982,I hope you’re okay ❤️ Don’t let the negativity and toxic people get to you! Take the time you need and focus on your family and mental health 🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼🫶🏼 LOVE YOU!
8607,I love you Colleen!!! I’m always here for you.
1616,"I was untangling my headphones to plug them in and watch this and then I saw the ukulele and was like….mm, maybe not?"
1582,Wow. The weird ukulele playing just shows how much of this is a facade. Not taking anything seriously... Shame.
8975,Colleen We love you!! ❤ Screw the haters!
6346,"Yo Colleen just give it up, you're  CANCELED!!!"
9942,"I've never clicked this fast in my life love you colleen ❤ Mistakes help you grow and have made you who you are standing here today - a sweet, kind and beautiful human being 💟 don't let anyone tell you otherwise"
10024,Omg
7642,who told you this was a good idea????
8237,What the fuck..
7814,So happy to see you again Colleen!!!! 💛
1730,wow this is an all new level and basically takes away any actual apology you previously issued after all the stuff that is coming out I can not offing believe this. I have been a regular commenter I have even gotten comments back from you Colleen I have loved your videos. this one though......I'm honestly ashamed and I am now unsubbing
4166,should’ve stayed in the drafts
5161,Wow this is super mature. 🙄 And it wasn’t just one mistake. It was multiple mistakes over a very long time. Maybe it’s time to move on to a new career….
7664,This idiot thinks she’s in a musical 🤣 take accountability weirdo . There’s receipts of your actions. A simple “im sorry” was all you have to do
8638,"I hope your doing well Colleen, I do believe it’s a big miscommunication but I really hope your alright. ❤"
4588,Ive said from the start from the first time anyone said anything.... y'all just clout chasing
3779,This is a joke right? Girl just apologize to the people you hurt🤯
4067,"Colleen, I know you are a great person and that you didn’t mean anything bad. You only wanted to be nice to your followers. But, it looks to me, they are now using some things against you because they want some attention on them. It is nice to see you. I know you are not the way they want to present you. 💜💜💜"
6522,she knows what she did was wrong she literally doesn’t care
115,❤
8263,Omg I love you so much queen. YOU DESERVE BETTER QUEEN.
525,This is brilliant!
2732,LMFAOOOO
279,i can’t believe anyone would think those kind of things abt colleen. please don’t stop doing what are you’re doing colleen. you still have people out there that love you and love seeing your content! ❤
9172,We aren’t all perfect we’re also not in group chats with minors sending inappropriate messages so there’s that 🫠
224,F*@! them little trolls!  You rock!! ❤
5916,"😞 Colleen I’m so sorry that you are going through this. You’ve already been through enough. This isn’t right or fair for you or your babies. Please just bare down with your family, friends and loved ones and weather this storm until it passes. Because it will pass ❤."
6685,love you friend. stay stong. cancel culture is harsh. 🖤
3400,"I’ve been watching your daily vlogs since before the twins were born, not for a second would I think you’d do something like that and have bad intentions. We do all make mistakes and I’ll definitely keep watching when you are ready to come back ❤"
4639,what happened to shame
151,"This is like the weirdest thing to care about, you guys. I believe her, but still, I DON’T CARE! So over people thinking they’re social justice warriors on the phone. If she did something that warrants jail time, then that would be brought out in a trial. You think the Hollywood elites are trying to protect f**king Colleen Ballinger?! (Sorry Coll, love you)…but like for REAL?! Leave her alone. This is so inconsequential."
2563,"You could’ve said, or done, literally anything and people would’ve immediately jumped down your throat. Like you said, it’s not going to change anyone’s mind. At least those of us who still haven’t jumped on the cancel bandwagon were able to hear your viewpoint."
6525,So... taking advantage of fans so you can get free and cheap labor is not manipulation?
5843,did u rlly have to do a corny ass song though like be fr
7299,ummm i dont think ANYONE is having fun and THIS is NOT the way you should have addressed things...ugh this all sucks girl😢😢😢😢
6672,Worst response to this ever LMAO. Grow up
3328,girl.... 😭😭😭
8642,I’m so happy you’re back. I missed you so much and it was so hard seeing all those people believe those stories that were clearly just for fame. You are a light in this world and you have made me so happy
4463,I don’t think anyone on this train was having any fun let’s be honest
7192,I’m so glad to see you! I could feel this to my core. I’ve missed you. And I’ve always always respected how you continue to learn and grow. The true followers know you aren’t perfect and love you because of that. Because you are human and we can see the intent and the good kind person in you. You are so freaking strong. I can’t imagine the pain you’re going through. Sending love to you and your family. Xoxo
2612,Cancel this loser forever plzz
171,I hate cancel culture so much😩 she’s corny but she’s not a bad person… i don’t understand why people today feel so entitled and feel like the world owes them something. Every vid that came out about her was such a fucking reach.
6763,This is so similar to sienna mae lmfao. Do something terrible and come back with a song/dance 😑
6927,I love you Colleen Miranda Sings ❤
7125,Colleen I was such a die hard fan but after these serious issues have been raised and you pull out a ukulele… oh girl 🙁
8467,i dont usually write comments but i felt like i should add to the positivity in here. i still support you as do many others. stay strong and never stop fighting for whats right no matter how dark things will get and how often thngs might feel like they go down. once youre rock bottom the only place left to go is up.
6372,"Couldn’t watch everything, skipped a few seconds. I guess she sings through the whole thing."
5289,Perfect response. Stop mob mentality. Stop conflating facts for opinions.
4275,the fuk
3484,"we all make mistakes, yours are just very public. i still love you and will be here when you decide to come back. sending so much love to you ❤️"
315,this made me giggle
1057,??????
6422,Girl put the ukulele down omfg 😭
6691,Oh girl……. This is not it…
9369,I never believed the rumours for a second!! And I still don’t believe ! I believe in Colleen
517,Omg Colleen I freaking love u so damn much. Know that I stick up for u everywhere and I’m sure im not the only one. I’m so glad u r back. I am so so damn sorry u r going through this. U r the best person ever imo. Ppl ruin every and anything good… omg I’m so damn sorry Colleen. I can’t imagine what this feels like
8949,"You are a human being, of course mistakes are made.But that does not mean your entire life should be thrown under the bus. You will come back stronger, give yourself time."
5928,"Colleen, there’s a difference between “intention” and “outcome”/“impact”….. you seem confused"
5254,"Girl, it wasn’t only one mistake it was many many many many many many many mistakes, almost like they weren’t mistakes and just your normal behaviour :/"
2199,what the hellll 😭😭
3578,This is not the time for an Ukulele Colleen. This is so bad but so funnily cringy at the same time.
467,You guys need to STOP hating on Colleen yeah she may have done that but NOBODY knows the truth except her and the victim you guys don’t know and and stop it
3006,RIP
1623,This is not okay.
912,Horrified looks from everyone in the room… 😳
210,Y is this kinda good
2565,WHAT IN THE FUCK DID I JUST WATCH
4022,LMFAO THIS IS NOT REAL
30,Ok but at least she said sorry
3739,And after 10 plus years after seeing new specialists that knew about the neurological conditions of the brain told me and my dad that my case was a full-blown case of Tourettes. It wasn't anxiety it wasn't tics it was a full-blown out of control case of Tourettes Yes I do have anxiety but it's so separate from my anxiety!
5194,Thanks for making this so much worse for yourself
1896,🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅
2078,girlie is going to jail
562,"At the very beginning of collen's yt career, she has been sharing with us how introvert, shy,loner  little girl or even up to now she is. This yt thing and popularity is not even her intention why she is making yt videos up until now. So if we come and think of it, she is not used to having a lot of attention from anyone. We should all be understanding and give everyone a chance to grow from their mistakes. Our generation is far different from their's, it is nice to see that young people are making a change, but we should not shame anyone for making something wrong especially if it's the past and that person is trying to have a life and change for the better."
1377,BYEEEE LMAOOO
2107,girl what
9732,I’ve been so worried about you and hoped you’d be back soon!
810,This is in bad taste
482,❤
9560,I personally could never and will never believe all the crappy things people are saying about you. You are one of if not the most genuine person I watch on the internet and I will defend you when it comes down to it. I love you! Try to keep your head up 💕
4622,"We love you and I never gave those haters my time, attention, or views. We know you, we support you. be strong and keep being yourself!"
3462,girl 😭 can’t believe I used to idolize u when I was 9
3124,We've missed you
7540,What is wrong with you? Honestly how do you think this is appropriate?
9149,I cant imagine what shes going through rn esp as a mom and her reputation is forever ruined but its a little weird to make this as a song
3350,girl.....
5071,Cue the I was dissociating excuse.
6106,so..... this fucking sucks
7390,i’m crying what the fuck is wrong with u LMFAOFNDUDKS
3406,"I think this was great! I feel for you and it sucks that mistakes that you have made in the past are being used against you now…like you said, we all make mistakes, it doesn’t make us bad people, it only makes us human. I’m praying for healing and strength for you and your family. This all has to be so overwhelming. Continue being you, and take care of yourself and your beautiful family, it will all be okay!"
5770,❤
4965,I'm so glad to see you in my feed! I missed you ❤ no matter what people say
1863,Wow you can tell she’s bulimic. So skinny with swollen facial glands….yikes

1613,"Well, what exactly were the “mistakes”? I know what they were, but I’m not sure you do….."
9454,Some people are desperate for clout. Wanting to cancel someone. We love you Colleen ❤️
65,Like get it queen!
4255,ok
7641,"Ok so i have no idea what's going on but Is this a first? Like a singing ""apologie"", i'm just flabbergasted."
6678,"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceKMnyMYIMo&t=6m18s"">6:18</a> you’re right, we do believe you’re the type of person who manipulates children<br><b>because you DID</b>"
4542,YIKES.
5778,You got to be fucking kidding me
1914,I love you Colleen ❤ haters back off never meant so much as it does now 🥰
9640,Stay strong Colleen ❤
262,I have always seen some hate comments and felt very sorry for the creator who is receiving the message but this is infuriating me. i have watched you since i was very very young and i know you think a lot about what you put on the internet and you are always very careful. i do not believe these rumors are true and i love you! stay strong❤️
563,I think this is an unexpected way to respond to all these recent news but I do know she is not only not these horrible things but I know she will learn and grow and I think it’s important to see that people change in the span of 5 years and even 1 year.
2099,You smell
387,😍😍😍😍😍😍
7573,"Impact is greater than intention. You may not have bad intentions, but the impact you made has been greatly negative. This isn’t taking accountability, you took a serious situation you are involved in and made a song about you being a victim. You state that there’s “facts” but do not state any of them. If your past actions were a mistake, you apologize. You haven’t don’t this in this “quirky little song”. <br><br>You’re right, people on the internet are cruel and take things way too far. But I’m extremely disappointed in you."
1261,"I support you Colleen. Whatever this BS is, I support you, miss you, and believe you’re a good person."
1388,speechless
2241,I’m so embarrassed I watched you for so long.
7905,A lot of us will always watch and support.
4355,Girl are you fuckin serious?
3733,PUKE
8374,So happy to see your face❤❤❤
9690,"Colleen I love you so much, I hope you’re doing well❤️❤️"
5955,"Holy crap, you did not make a song for this..."
5662,"""but not in a creepy way"" YOURE JOKING RIGHT ?"
1912,Bestie. We. Saw. The. Screen. Shots. Wtf do you mean NOT TRUE?! And the FACT this is on YOUR SECOND channel? Lol you have no accountability whatsoever
6247,Can’t wait to see how this shit show goes
4562,Did you really think this was the right answer?
8648,Love you Colleen ❤
8755,KM SO GLAD YOUR BACK OMG I WAS SO WORRIEDZ
3259,Is this real
1688,I just wanna say to people like me that are reading comments trying to make up their minds about who is right and who is wrong that probably there is truth in all sides of the story and it's okay to reflect on those sides and take our own lessons but please just be kind ❤
2599,Read the room 😭
4102,Someone please tell me this is an SNL skit
3029,I want to know how many takes of this she took to get it right 😅
8709,WE LOVE YOU COLLEEN ❤❤❤❤
6017,"No way you posted this and were like ""yeah they'll love this! This is a great response!"" What was going on in your mind that made you think posting this was a good idea in the SLIGHTEST jesus christ you had to be sipping on lean or some shit"
8476,Hey Colleen I hope you ok your amazing I hope those things are not true and if they are I hope u have learnt
6923,I'm so sorry you're going through this

1127,yep shes dead inside
661,this is so smart
7857,I love you Colleen! Welcome back 💕
7143,Uh-
4007,Is this real?!? Wow Colleen. You don’t deserve your platform. This was literally so bad. <br>But you already said you don’t care about the comments so I do hope you lose your platform
7209,"You're a joke, this is unbelievable"
8996,I’m very happy to see you back💜I love you
2017,Talking about people monetizing off your downfall yet you still had to meet that 10 minute mark huh 💀
9986,Omg hi I have missed you
2775,This feels so condescending. As if she’s singing to us like children. It’s very demeaning to be honest. Not a good look at all.
4609,I was a fan of you for over 10 years! It's incredibly disappointing to see that you're actually a terrible person
6420,no shot
41,Bruh
2087,Lmaoooo girl u good .. for a person who got kids u really something else to treat children the way u do qnd then got the nerve to sing abt . Good luck to you and hope ur kids never have to go through what u put does kids through
2196,stop pls
7538,this was basically just making fun of the victims for 10 minutes. you're so pathetic.
8398,❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤
3061,That whole video and you didn’t take accountability for one single thing 🤔 oof
282,Hey Colleen. This is just a moment and it may feel like torture that it will never go away. Focus on your family and yourself. This too shall past.
9678,Colleen i love you and always will!! Now and forever one of your biggest fans ❤❤ take care hun I wish there was a way I could talk to you!!! Hope you see my comment  🤞 been watching since 2012.
4280,"We love you Colleen!!! You’re great, and some may not agree but just know you still have a team!! 🩷 love ya girl, keep your head up!"
226,"Few days ago I had no idea who you are but wow, iconic"
7562,literally what the hell is this dude?....
3052,Bye.
942,🙃🙃🙃🙃
9071,We all love you Colleen and I know millions of people can agree with that. We all make mistakes. I personally never judge people from their past and many people don't as well. I also know that the bad comments outweigh the good ones even though there are more than triple the amount of good than bad. We are here to support you and appreciate everything you do. ♥️♥️♥️
2205,THE UKULELE IM CRYINNNNNNNN
6452,you really think you ate….
6303,A FUCKING UKULELE 💀💀💀
1303,girllll this corny shittt LMFOAOA
8862,Sending love and strength to you and your family! I was at the Chicago show and the real ones are still here to support. ❤❤ Take time to heal and spend every second with those beautiful little ones.
392,I think this is Brilliant to be honest 😂😂😂😂 go Colleen and please look after yourself ❤❤
3908,"same people you supported and tried to please are now turning on you and trying to cancel you. it’s sad and ridiculous.  keep pushing on, everyone make mistakes and people just want to blow it out of proportion. still have my support see you in september! fuck the crying people in the comments"
8490,I'm sorry? You wanted to be besties with kids? It's inappropriate. Take some accountability
5775,You are unhinged. Stop this.
1389,☠️
4896,You have to be joking
1126,I refuse to believe you sat here and sang for 10 whole minutes ans tried to guilt trip us 💀
57,"Didn't she play a ukulele in some other videos? I have watched on and off for years and I remember her doing that at some point, maybe about haters or pregnancy or something like that.. i can't remember."
6355,how did you think this was smart
5286,ugh. i miss your videos and can’t wait for this to all be over.
7272,This is too funny
3467,This is such Scorpio behaviour lol love it
1441,Cancel culture is ridiculous lmao
4061,this is terrible
5762,* Writes a song about taking responsibility for their actions*<br><br>angry mob mentality * not enough responsibility!*
168,"People suck, its ok. Keep your head up"
4800,girl what
9818,opening this video with a song is 100% a colleen move
9409,OMFG!!
10008,Love you Colleen ❤
8738,Girl you could’ve just said you were wrong and apologized. But I guess acting like you’re the victim is easier?
1938,Is the accountability here in the room with us right now?
7331,never seen an apology like this…
2028,Put the ukelele DOWNN
349,❤❤❤
544,💕💕💕💕💕
5915,Don't mind the haters girl! Thanks for the explanation and good vibes😊
6454,"We all make mistakes, and bringing up the past when you’ve already taken accountability is confusing- I’ve seen countless videos monitizing from your “cancelling”. That’s what it’s all about for them! Nothing better to do, gen Z+ bothers me… if I were you I would silence the haters by continuing your career, vlogs, shows! You did coin “Haterz back Off” ❤ they’ll move on to the next person soon enough as they always do"
4038,"For anyone thinking that this an apology from her or a ""pathetic excuse of an apology"" it isn't, because she hasn't done anything wrong lol, doesn't feel she needs to so she won't. As she shouldn't. Get off the hype train kids, get a life and leave her alone!"
4009,you absolutely showed no remorse for the victims and you’re fans. shame on you.
9573,WOW SO EARLY
2772,I’m dead not a song 😂
1058,"Bye, Colleen this isn’t how apologies work."
1962,bro WHAT.
7250,Jesus effing Christ dude. Read the room. The children you hurt deserve more than a corny ass song.
1913,This is bad. Like really bad
894,What 😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
6414,Should’ve just left it alone girl
3580,Girl imma need you to be so f*cking fr
4524,How can you so self aware and also so delusional at the same time… she legit is aware of the comments for this… biggest fucking yikes
265,This song is a banger
1493,This is why I still love & support colleen! ❤ colleen I wish you peace&  comfort during this time of people doing what people seem to do these days& know there's still a lot of us who love you & want the best for you
7383,girl fr
3696,Sending you and your family love… let her be human people! You aren’t perfect either! No matter what she does or doesn’t do says or doesn’t say will never be enough.
6818,Truly this could not be in poorer taste LMAO
4015,Y’all are saying this is a bad “apology” video but she literally never stated this was an apology lol
6287,your not serious??? like this is a joke 😭
9107,"I just thought with a husband, 3 kids , a new house , and Miranda Tour you’ve been pretty busy. Pray things get better. Miss your video’s."
4047,"People that actually loves you will move on from your mistake. The ones that don’t just don’t realize how they hurt Colleen more than how much you hurt them. Love you 🥰 Colleen, please come back."
4960,you’re a strange strange woman
2492,"The perfect title would've been ""Ear bleeding song of me pretending to take accountability for views"""
1318,You aren’t intimidating anyone by having your eyebrows up the whole song.
4403,what?
2507,aint no fucking way this is real
7785,GIRL??? Rumors ??? THERE ARE SCREENSHOTS.
8181,girl you are SOOOO unserious LMAO
5999,Please come back. You are such an anxiety outlet for me everyday. Miss you and Eric and the kids
9316,"I can already see people hating on her for singing about this.<br><br>Edit: I’m glad she’s speaking about this in the way she knows best, through music. It’s best to hear her out and have her take responsibility for her actions."
3565,well done colleen!!!! this video is going down in youtube history as the cringiest thing ever posted :)
6259,"Does she really have to sing to ""apologize""? I mean, even if she didn't, this apology video still sucks."
4073,what the fuck😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭😭
3796,why
6059,Hope you and your kids are okay. some of these people online are clearly making this their whole personality on Twitter for likes. They tweet about it 100 times a day for a month straight like that Johnny guy. Whatever gets them likes.
3639,Holy shit no way this is real 😅
1378,The video is more weird with the song …
3267,What the actual duck
5872,When you have to say they “aren’t quite true” that means most of it IS and you are in the wrong.
7693,"You barely addressed anything let alone the screen shots which I think the majority of people wanted you to do, this is so bad that I don't even think you could count it as an ""apology"" please seek professional help"
7865,What the fuck
792,and the song isn’t even good .. girl
7615,"Please be so for real 😭this isn’t it, this isn’t how you take accountability, your pr team prob had a very very good reason for you not saying much abt it 😭"
9731,"You hang in there colleen! You are brave, a good person and a great momma. ❤"
4283,oh my god???????????
7145,girl…
4454,?????????
3081,I'm at work so i can't watch this yet but I love you so much and I really hope you cone back us. I gor sure really need you.
407,I love you!! I love you!! I love you!! I miss your vlogs!! Be safe and keep healing!!
9886,love you so so much
3161,girl
4785,Bruh she really whipped out a ukelele and did this?!?!?  There ain't no waaaaaaay
9413,I've missed youuuuuu 🫶
3625,WHAT THE FUCK
8554,"Wow, this is worse than I ever could have imagined"
7633,"So happy you responded this way. I’m so tired of cancel culture. You’ve taken accountability about this before and you’ve changed, that should be enough."
4406,Wait is this shit really just her singing for 10 minutes…………
769,I love you ❤
7844,There she goes playing the victim again... Pathetic
7045,is she for real.
7394,"i have never left a comment before- but i feel urged to today. colleen, seeing you posted today made my entire day. i hope you are doing okay throughout all of this. we all miss you so much☀️🔆🧡💛"
9357,Never believed what people were saying really I thought it was being blown way out of proportion but a song surrounding this matter was a strange move
6366,For everyone that wants to see her grovel and cry: FU
9873,omg you’re back ❤
4521,SUCH A WHITE WOMAN RESPONSE
5406,"Colleen, we all made weird shit, the thing is you are an internet person, so you are public, the good things, the bad shits… take care of you, open a singing school, take care of your kids, your hubby❤"
5606,i...what?
8316,BRO WHAT🫣😭 …… this is ODD
5876,"I really feel like this isn't the way to go about this. We've all seen the messages, we've seen the videos from the shows, we've heard from your fans and what has happened to them. Taking accountability is necessary here. You can still hurt people no matter what your intentions are. This is a mockery of the people who you have hurt. Your intentions in this video is very self serving ""I won't survive in the crash"" instead of ""I'm sorry for the bad things I've done and the people I've hurt"".... see the difference?"
3434,Not reaching for the Ukulele in the first 4 seconds
1071,Girl…..
3465,"lol she was gonna stop, noticed the video wasn’t 10 minutes and kept on making a fool of herself"

5520,i totally believe your intentions and who you are as a person but PR team was right on this one😖
2614,Girl wdym not based on facts. There are multiple people who were there saying things abt you and loads of screenshots just get over yourself
8700,"Colleen, I watch your Videos for many many years and I always loved your humor and that it always felt like I'm one of your best friends!❤ Keep your head up, we are here for you! XOXO🤗😘❤️"
6808,As someone who was a huge fan of you from 2014-recent and idolized you for many of those years… this apology video really makes me sad. I really wish you were capable of taking accountability. You’ve lost a fan in me.
6884,I had not heard any of the rumours but I would like to say you are so loved and supported. I hope you can push aside the negatively and come through this. Love you ❤❤❤
3954,Trash

9666,Love you so much 💕
9758,I miss your posts. I don't believe anything they say. Keep you head up this to will end .
9811,no way she started an apology vid with a ukulele song
965,mf thinks she’s ariana grande when she said they couldn’t say i couldn’t sing
369,"Colleen, be strong in who you are. We know your heart, and we too can see through the lies.  This response was spot on, gutsy, and true!"
7496,expected better from u idk
3383,This isnt accountability…its just you saying everyone is lying and you did no wrong…
9231,Please come back! I miss you so much. I’m so sorry your having to go threw this.
730,You go Colleen!🥰🥰🥰🥰 Love you!  I don’t care what the haters think!
3298,So this is a children song 😂
4441,How did her PR people approve this lmao
6895,Colleen I love you so much and I applaud you for coming on here and defending yourself! I think you are an amazing person and yes mistakes were made but what is being said is so far from true. Your true fans love you and we know what kind of person you are. Hold your head up high! I love you
2506,Bruh.
2811,Missed you Colleen!
774,"Just wanted to let you know that the whole internet might be in rage about this song and the whole situation but you are still someone I look up to as a strong af and truly loving momma. I followed your vlogs for the past two years while I became a Mom myself, Never really commenting but now I felt the need to… because everyone deserves love and support as a human being and you might have screwed up in your online past but you do so much in your personal Life for your children and Family and that‘s worth so much if Not even more. You might not be welcomed back in the online community for a while but I wish you only the best and all the love from your close Family and friends and you as a Human being are okay Just the way you are - with all your flaws and mistakes. Cause let‘s Not forget: we‘ve all got them. Difference is, ours are not presented and talked about all around the world… best wishes and cuddle the kiddos - M. ❤"
1527,"colleen, babe, put the ukulele away.."
804,THIS IS AWFUL
5476,"People seem to forget you grow as you learn more about the world, you cant expect it to go great in the beginning shes obviously grown"
1869,I still ❤ you coleen!
8663,"Can i just say this made me cry, its such a shame this is what the internet is coming to draging up past mistakes and taking it out of proportion poor colleen so many people will be here for you and when you are ready take your time with your beautiful little family come back because so many people miss you, you are so loved and your content is enjoyed by so many people miss you loads know you are a great person,you are who i look up to, to be a good mum to my daughter who is due the 8th of September sending you so many virtual hugs and please please dont let this get in your way as a strong woman ❤️ much love 😢😊❤❤"

5858,It’s sad that we can’t see the dislike button
538,RESPOND LIKE A NORMAL PERSON PLEASE AND STOP MAKING US SOUND LIKE WERE THE BAD GUYS U LITERALLY GR00MED KIDS
6191,"you have to be fucking kidding me. how the fuck does anyone do what she did and then decide ""yes, a 10 minute ukelele song is clearly the only way to respond to this."" i am so sorry to all her victims, you deserve so much more that whatever this fucking is."
9772,I freaking love you. Thank you for this. ❤
98,ok but the song kinda slapped.
9754,I love you girl. Stay strong! ❤❤
2200,‘that aren’t quite true’ there are videos…
816,"First of all, apolgies should never be about YOU. It’s not for your “defense” it’s for the people you HURT to be able to get through this. And “PG13” is not a 18+ show. The girl you spread her legs on the stage at 16 while she was wearing no pants is not 13+. The apologies are for people like her. You are over 30. I’ve been a fan of you for years, but this is sickening."
1630,She only posted this now once she realized @h3podcast is on their break
3287,It’s giving Rachel berry
2884,yikes
4618,what did I just watch?
4472,"Oh girl, this was not the move. I think you need to take a step back to think for a bit."
9329,Everyone has a past and makes mistakes. We grow. Keep your chin up girl ❤
3656,I don’t give a fuck what anyone thinks everyone always needs a person to cancel but everyone makes mistakes chillen is a great person and a great mom I love you always Colleen I pray you find your peace honey🩷
1997,"I think I'm going into actual, medical shock what on earth IS this??? What are you doing?????"
673,i fucking love the internet so much
8495,We support you and your family!❤️
9221,oh please
3074,it’s giving…..logical fallacies ☠️
1991,"Girl, what were you thinking?!!"
8538,Yikes.
8777,Hopefully you can come back on here and be yourself with your cute family 😻
1191,"Girl no there was a whole evidence, why are u holding a ukelele 😭"
8020,All our family love and support you….don’t let them bully you off here! Xx
5166,Noooo 🤣🤣🤣🤣
4439,I kept thinking there was no way the song would go all ten minutes but it just kept going like a terrible car crash
4282,shes really playing the ukulele rn
3638,Where are the lyrics? lol
7606,"you do NOT get to decide that you didn’t hurt people. what you should’ve done was taken in all this information and APOLOGIZED TO THESE PEOPLE. but instead you made a joke of a video, calling them liars."
8691,Girl i hope you lose custody of your kids
2680,what the fuck is this LMFAO
7286,GIRL WHY ARE YOU SINGING
7403,"okay so you took the angry route instead? you could've sang & actually said sorry & meant it. <br>nobody is having fun with this. you chose to stay silent this long, what were people supposed to think?"
1618,Okay Gabbie hanna
182,I wish I could give you a big hug right now. :(
3501,I feel like I’m watching a dramatized episode of Victorious
7535,"""F me right"" at the end.... not needed theres enough going on in the world without cancel culture but this wasn't the way to go about this 😢😢😢"
197,"I pray you are not in agony right now, because we all know how hard you take things and how much you overthink. There are still people out here who love you Colleen. I'm praying for you and your family. Everything will come out in the wash. Stay strong and please eat something ❤"
7452,Colleen!!! I love you so much! I never once believed any of these lies. I'm so sorry your going through this. I'm heartbroken for you. You can get through this. I understand why you said it in a song. I have missed seeing your face. Take your time and heal. Come back when your ready. ❤❤❤
9865,we love you ❤
172,"I support you in this. You already apologized and addressed the things you did wrong years ago, so why should you apologize again for that, and additional things you don't believe you did? I'm glad to see you aren't letting cancel culture win and bowing to their demands. Please stay strong against it and don't cave and delete this or apologize when an apology is not deserved."
9613,bye
5666,❤
4080,It's not about entertainment or having fun. This was a mess.
346,Damn ok
2688,You are extremely unserious woman why tf are you addressing allegations while singing and playing the ukulele….
9112,I’m so glad to see you Colleen. Love you and I’m glad you are defending yourself against all of this
1335,oh no. oh noooooooooo.
8512,🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅
7105,We missed you!!! 💜 People needs to move on from a situation that happened years ago and that you already took accountability for. We know much you have chance and learn from those mistakes. We miss you and to keep seeing your content 😢
7263,Correction: In group chats with minors
5256,Idk how I feel about this
8309,What the fuck is this IJBOL
5416,I've missed you and I am sorry you are going through this. I know in my heart who you are and I will always support you.
7481,"PLEASE DONT LEAVE AGAIN 😢 they can leave, I’ve been watching you and Miranda since the very beginning.. my heart dropped when I saw you finally posted. I love you so much and I miss your little family ❤️"
8338,We’ve missed you❤
2334,"Colleen, you should have not said anything. You really just threw yourself under water girl."
9288,"We love you!!! I have missed your videos so much. ❤️ Your true fans know who you are, these people spreading lies just want to be famous."
1946,Worse than Laura lees response video when she got canceled 😪
4404,I don’t know what to think atp
2388,I think you should have taken a different approach. It’s lacks sincerity.
3670,Girl be SO FOR REAL RIGHT NOW lmfaoooooo
297,I’m with you Colleen💕 the things that are being said about you is unfair!
5304,As if she just sung an apology 😭
4459,Ooof babe this is tone deaf…
7666,Why are u singing colleen if u would have just said what u needed to say it would have blown away
393,"I want to say to everyone here;  I wish you all good things, and overload of LOVE! Give or get a hug today ❤"
353,"Colleen! I genuinely hope you read this because you were such an amazing person and unfortunately in the day and age we live in now people are insecure and get bored and like to pray on peoples downfalls and bring up past events just for an ounce of entertainment. You truly do not deserve any of the hate you’re receiving, please continue to keep your head up and stand up for what you think is right! My friends and I love you and look up to you so much! We will always support you❤️"
2435,oh my GOD shes weird
6890,I’m…….shook <br><br>……..but honestly……. I’m with her.
8802,Colleen you used your voice and music in the best way you could and you did that to feel comfortable while addressing this awful topic about you. NOTHING WRONG ABOUT THAT <br>Super proud colleen!<br><br>As long as we all know you're growing too and learning through it like everyone else is. Nobody else and their opinions should matter <br><br>Love and prayers to you!
9055,"Colleen, I’m all for allowing people to grow and learn and change. But this video as a response to everything that’s going on was not to way to come back. I’m disappointed because I really thought you would have reflected and actually acknowledged everything."
9954,Never clicked so fast
3496,there is absolutely no fucking way
3697,"Daaaamn, people really need to chill out. The Internet is such a toxic place... And they have the audacity to call themselves ""fans""... Love you, Colleen! Stay strong ❤"
1270,um.
5857,Seriously?
2135,Girl what the actual fuck
8976,I hope you know theres alot of people who see your heart and know you are such a loving person. We are here for you ❤️
7653,deranged human being what is actually wrong with you
8039,"Oh colleen, I don't know what's gone on, but I am so sorry whatever has happened. My daughter and I miss watching your videos so much, and I really hope you're ok. This made me cry. You're not a loser. you're really not. Ok, I'm going to be honest. I'm not a huge fan of miranda, but we love you. I just want you back to your usual self and making videos, I am so sorry of whoever is being toxic towards you. We miss you colleen 😢xx"
3031,God im so disappointed. Like girl really ick
5524,"who told her this song was a good idea. i really don’t understand. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceKMnyMYIMo&t=3m01s"">3:01</a> and <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ceKMnyMYIMo&t=4m07s"">4:07</a> = ✨delusional✨"
597,❤❤❤
5048,I’m speechless right now
7772,"I actually like this form of your apology. It’s you. It’s who you are. You sing, songs about everything you do, go through, experience etc. also, good for you for not caving and giving some bullshit apology. You know who you are. Nobody else does. That’s the shittt thing about the internet babes. Keep pushin."
9485,I never agreed with any of the stuff people are saying on the internet as I’ve always looked up to you ❤
2155,Start streaming reputation by Taylor swift
5034,"Dear Mir-fandas,<br><br>I'm sorry I upset you. I didn't mean to. It was really just a joke. I thought you could take a joke. But I guess I was wrong.<br><br>I've been teased before about wearing glasses but I never felt I had to tell the teacher about it and get someone else in trouble. Maybe you're just over-reacting?<br><br>I don't understand why you're so upset about such a small thing.<br><br>I thought we were friends.<br>Colleen"
7386,She needs to make a real apology not a song
3315,Can’t believe she still thinks this is a joke
3758,STOP PLEASE OH MY GOD
2351,Why did you apologize with a ukulele? You should be able to apologize normally
8457,you are so frightening
8364,you are an evil woman
6223,"Coleen-  Thank you for posting again!!  I will always be a fan!  Your videos brighten my day!   Your smile, your babies and family are amazing!  I look forward to you coming back and sharing your life!  You got this!  Huge fan from Houston!!!  Love you and Eric!"
6384,I love you anyway Colleen!
868,Girl you could have saved yourself...
8586,"I absolutely adore you and I'm so sorry you are going through this!! Your videos have helped me tremendously, especially as a mom. I really hope you keep making videos. Thank you so much for all that you do❤❤"
2783,LMAO this has to be a joke
9347,You’re such a good and hilarious person. People are evil and will always find something or twist it to be horrid. You are soooo loved! Love that you made a song about it. Freaking show them! ❤️
6719,wow okay I thought I was still supporting you until this terrible video.
5586,This was a good way of responding. I miss your videos. ❤
1679,Straight outta a Disney channel orginal😭
9045,Love you ❤
8368,Love you Colleen!! ❤ I’m glad you’re standing up for yourself and not giving into these people trying to bring you down!
1266,This is so deranged 😀
2012,Colleen this is such a brutal miscalculation
5850,The ukulele was not it
3825,Girl you literally groomed children there’s proof
7439,I’m embarrassed for you. You deserve to lose everything
3652,PG-13 isn’t spreading your fans’ legs on stage.
1871,Someone call you out for PEDOPHILIA and you decide to sing your apology
8315,i love you ❤
4491,Girl seriously what the fuck is this
3205,this has to be a joke right
1170,"This sucks, genuinely."
3531,"Good to see you Colleen! I missed your videos. You’re a kind, genuine person!"
302,i love you forever colleen im not even going to try to figure out why you got cancelled or why you're apologizing but i love you and thats all that matters i dont care what your past has to tell us.
3012,"i don’t know what i was expecting, not much, but definitely not a fucking song. this is unreal. it’s clear you don’t care whatsoever about what you put these people through. you could’ve maybe approached this way differently."
193,"Colleeeeennn, I’VE BEEN SO WORRIED ABOUT YOU. <br><br>my heart is with you.  And I believe in you."
7804,what timeline is this
5331,Way to go to disrespect the young people who felt uncomfortable.
1295,"You haven't addressed the people you hurt and used. You have added streamers and smears of lipstick to <b>serious</b> allegations. <br>Spreading a teen's legs is <b>automatically</b> sus, regardless of context.<br>You need to learn to be objective instead of reactive to criticism. <br>Because if you can't, I have a pretty good idea what  diagnoses might suit you..."
6069,MY QUEEN!!!!
7791,Absolutely not.<br>You literally caused people so much pain and you come on here with a damn song…<br><br>No.
27,I’m uh-
7054,"Colleen, I've missed you, I've been praying for you 🙏 ❤️ love you."
4065,you didn’t even apologize you absolutely have NOT taken accountability just bc you keep saying you did
8822,Omggg finally Colleen I’ve missed youuu so much 🥺🥺
2534,babes put the ukulele down...

3757,Oh honey no
3095,super dismissive. very disrespectful. not cute.
6118,Love you Colleen ❤️
8393,YESSSS !!!! LOVE YA !!!!!
1094,How passive aggressive can one person be?  Grow up!  You are an awful person and are still blaming the people you hurt!!!
2557,girl shut up. you were predatory. they were victims. minimizing their experiences won’t get you far.
8926,WE LOVE YOU
2760,...be so for real right now
1596,It’s not a mistake if it happened multiple times.
7741,yikes
3440,I’ve missed u
9234,💜
5242,you TRAUMATIZED children!!!!! THERES PROOF OF IT!!!! This is a big case of ukulele victimitis. Is this a joke to you?
7827,So happy to see you. ❤
4286,"we did have fun, thank u"
8249,"Colleen i love you!!! Just know i support you, i love you, and i’m sorry this is happening to you!"
4117,TALK ABOUT THE ALLEGATIONS‼️‼️‼️‼️
7940,i can’t believe you’re fooling all of these people in the comments AGAIN. you’re genuinely not a good person
4313,Lmaooooo ohh darling. They only thing I seen was a video about you talking about a dog you abused and got put down I was so shook that was sad. But I hope your mental health is ok. This song however 😂 I can not
9750,AWW WE MISS YOU!!❤ just know we are all supporting you and we know these people just want attention 💕💕
7137,❤❤
22,"This song is taken as insensitive , but knowing Colleen it’s her way of showing that she cares."
4882,Still love you lady
2058,absolutely REPULSIVE
8682,"Perfect response!!!  Come on back to us, it's where you belong. This too shall pass."
9527,I love you
8684,"Let's normalize celebrities defending themselves instead of doing what cancel culture  wants them to do and completely disappear 👏👏 she's allowed to be angry about millions of people lying, you would be angry too!!!"
8410,💓💓
1677,Did she literally filter his name out of the comments? I haven’t seen it once??
8308,This is so out of touch. You have caused irreparable damage and harm to a vast amount of people. And instead of acknowledging this and owning up (because there is literally proof) you’re singing?? Unbelievable
8785,colleen please be so fucking for real
6982,girl what is this
4607,You are out of your mind for posting this
2243,she’s officially lost her mind
6589,I kinda like it 🙊
6371,So you're going to try and Zoey Deschanel/quirky girl your way out of this?
6104,So proud of you! ❤️
6611,oh i’ve been waiting for this one😏🤣
9616,i love you so moch
5668,"Theres plenty of people (aside from youtubers as well) who have changed from their pasts, and become better people, thats how we grow as humans. But most of if not all of them apologize authentically with statements whether it be in person or online. I appreciate the idea behind this personally, as a commentary on apology videos as well, but with so many screenshots and reciepts I think you need to do more than just this. People were really hurt, Colleen. I’m writing this as a previous fan, and person who always looks to kindness and positivity. I think most people know that Miranda is PG-13, but still most of the fans of Miranda are children so it’s not fair to them to be put in situations they don’t understand but adults do. I hope you read this specific comment from a place of caring and love, because as a previous fan I do care about you as a human being. We all make mistakes, but to grow you have to embrace the mistakes. Certain things need to be addressed not defensed. (Also why was this not posted on the main channel?)"
608,"Colleen, it is important to grow from your mistakes from your past. Although everyone makes mistakes, it is important to take accountability with responsibility. Everyone does things wrong, life goes astray, but you owning up to your mistakes and growing from them is very important. You did just that. Please don't let the unencouraging comments get to you. ❤"
9188,This isn’t how I expected you to come back but I’m so glad it is. Some of us still really love you and support you.❤
5567,Omg D:
1182,Well this is the most delusional video I have ever seen. Just do absolutely anything so you don't take accountability I guess. You're such a quirky gatekeep gaslight girl boss with your random song. Imagine writing this song because you got caught out bullying teenagers and being inappropriate.. I can't..
143,"Everyone needs to sit down and take a second. If she would have sat there and made like a 25min video apologizing, you guys would call her a liar, say you don't care and say ""she's only responding because she got caught"". If she never responded, you guys would say she's guilty. If she completely stuck up for herself, you guys would also say she's a liar and say that you've already seen the facts. So now she gives you a response, not meant as an apology, just kind of saying ""don't believe everything you see"" because guess what, there's two sides to everything. I have been a fan for years, and yes what I have seen is really sickening and it makes me really sad, but I'm not going to bash her before I've even heard her side. This whole cancel culture shit is really fucking annoying, I swear people aren't even fans of her and are bashing on her. Chill tf out."
1005,This isn’t the one babe
8524,I’ve missed you and have been really worried about you! So glad to see your face again.
5290,"this is the most unhinged thing i think ive ever seen surface youtube, worse than dramageddon. what the hell is going on😭"
9781,thank you for speaking out. i love you! 💕
1144,Womp womp
5099,u cant even sing girl
7000,I love u Colleen ❤️❤️❤️
8701,"Colleen the people that know and love you and your family are here for you , keep your chin up things will fix themselves out ❤"
955,did she even say sorry? or like... she says mistake singular
7397,Comments criticizing you are hidden
4032,"Woop i'm so out of the loop with the whole Colleen hoover is bad thing, but this is truly one of the most tone deaf responses I have EVER seen"
5120,oh girl this is not it….
2802,"I agree with her, all the fans are weirdos and love to crucify someone for their past. You know damn well she wasn’t trying to do anything inappropriate with her fans. You just want a reason to be mad at someone."
7388,This is a wild thing for a grown adult to post.
7773,I’m so proud of you colleen 🤎
5078,Yikes
3188,😂😂😂😂😂
5722,if you don't put that damn ukulele down
973,"i hated this, surely it has to be a bit"
1072,Girl… no.
7002,"Oh you sweet thing. I am tearing up watching this. Im so sorry this is happening to you.  As someone who has made a serious mistake in my life, I know how it can feel. I cannot even imagine being in the public eye. Please stay strong.  You, your kids, your husband all know your a wonderful person/mom/wife and thats all that matters."
4081,You almost have to admire her utter audacity pulling such a ludicrous stunt like this to absolve herself of blame for her crimes involving literal children
1740,Probably not the best choice to do an apology video.
5018,HAHAHAHHA
9306,I love you Colleen I’ve been a fan for a long time just keep your head up the real ones will always stick up for you your sweet person who doesn’t deserve this i stand with you 💕it’s going to be ok even tho it probably doesn’t seem like it rn
2384,why would you think this is a good idea 😭😭😭😭😭
1404,Maybe you should’ve listened to your team 😄👍
9627,Love you Colleen💕
967,Colleen. You made KIDS put their hands down your trousers at your shows. You haven’t taken ANY accountability what the fuck is this?
6774,This is bad
8376,what is wrong with you
9976,FINALLY ADDRESSING
6291,now who told her this was a good idea 💀😭
2209,LMFAO SHE REALLY WROTE A SONG💀💀💀💀💀

7034,Bruh

1095,LMFAOOOOO  WHY TF IS SHE SINGING THIS CANT BE REAL LIFEE💀💀💀💀💀💀💀💀
2343,boohoo not colleen playing victim bc proof came out she’s a shitty person
3804,NOT THE UKULELE
1154,pls tell me this isn’t your real apology 😭😭😭
3926,LOL how can a teen manipulate you? oof. there’s complete proof colleen.👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
1712,This is far from taking any accountability whatsoever
2303,Girl why 🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️🤦🏻‍♀️
8414,This video is the BEST! I love it❤❤. Your response is perfect.
5225,Is this…an apology??😂😂
9363,❤
7941,💗💗
2648,Girl put that guitar down
9009,f*** you for this seriously
7364,"Hi Colleen! I don’t know to say. Other then there are still a bunch of us that still love you and are glad that one, your ok. And two, that you are taking responsibility for your actions. Everyone makes mistakes like that a lot. But I have seen more then that over the years. I’ve seen you love, laugh, and be your TRUE self around others. Including us. 😌. Not only that. But also saw you become a mom and teach THREE new kids about the world around them, and I can’t think of anyone else with that many and that young if kids that’s doing as good as you! You created the phase “Haters Back Off” and are sticking with it! And we love you for that. Some people never change or give up or anything! Your one of those people colleen 😘😌<br><br><br>I know you did not have bad intentions. But saying your sorry is the best you can do. And because your doing that, and having the gut to do it now on the internet no doubt. That’s a true queen!"
4058,"Maybe she can’t talk details for legal reasons, but she keeps mentioning the facts, so what are the facts? Tell us how the evidence and receipts are wrong. Go ahead. Because right now not being able to prove that these so called “facts” aren’t being listened to or taken into consideration is making the situation look even worse. Idk how one looks at damning evidence and goes that’s not right, then refuses to elaborate how. I just want everything out in the open."
6381,nah i’m cackling wtaf this is WILDDDDDDDDDSS
7335,Shameful
8539,"It’s important to think, Do you judge someone by the worst thing they do or the best thing they do?"
5665,"when the red flags wave themselves, believe them. 🚩you should have put the ukulele away and listened to your team."
6250,Colleen really? You’re right btw…. This is disappointing 😑
6267,girl what 😭
3903,This is actually comical
5448,what the literal fuck
1068,I don’t recognize you in this video :/
2441,no way this is real 😭
2572,"go girl, ignore the comments like you ignored the rolling stone article"
7847,saw you last week in indy and will continue to send you love and support. we all make mistakes and we have to learn and grow for them! the bandwagons of hatred and misinformation people jump on are hideously alarming. thank you for finally talking about this! ❤ you deserve to be heard and have your apology listened to and accepted!
5169,This will go down in YouTube history
1492,This cannot be serious
6092,This is almost as bad as when sienna Mae responded to serious allegations with a dance video 💀💀
3070,This wasn't it. This isn't taking accountability. This resolves nothing.
2722,Is all true tho mate
9672,Happy you are getting through this!! Have been watching you for YEAAARSSSS and I know you are a good person
2363,I’m sad this is happening many years after it happened. (B4 y’all come for me Trisha to me is way worse)
7280,I’d delete this if I were you
9825,Umm
867,"oh my fucking god.<br>two fucking weeks to have this as an ""apology""<br>fucking bullshit."
511,Colleen. I love you so much.<br>What you did was wrong BUT a you HAVE CHANGED!!<br>I’m Amman from your Thousand Oaks show.<br>You are amazing and I will always appreciate you.
9503,colleen i think you should’ve listened to your team on this one.
6874,Awwwwwe Colleen!!!!!!!!
7356,stay strong
8815,Haters Back Off!!!!!!!
4223,YOU SHOULDVE LISTENED TO YOUR TEAM 😭😭😭😭😭
4735,what the hell is this🤡🤡
9539,I hope you're okay. Thank you for opening your home and life to us that care about you and your family. We love you. I will continue to support you and your family.
4561,She's a mom! That's what baffles me
3544,oh that’s not-
6491,Does she not know what people are mad about?
9169,Maybe shouldn’t over share in the first place?
8660,Please come back to vlogging your real fans miss you!😊
4586,This is baddddd
4614,"If someone took advantage of me then put THIS video out I would feel worse. I know everything happened a few years ago, some of it still ongoing at her shows but time doesn't heal wounds. Traumatic experiences stick in your brain forever but to make a song about how you're not sorry for what you did and not acknowledging you did something wrong is pathetic and like I said, revictimizing.<br><br> The good news is, she cant claim defamation because there are videos and text messages to prove it."
2191,how disappointing was this... wow
4307,NO WAY.
2991,"Are you freakin’ kidding me? This is how you respond? Taking no accountability whatsoever, even with all the proof that’s been produced. Absolutely disgusted right now."
1978,this is so gabbie hannah
8895,Missed you 😢❤
8402,This!! ❤❤❤❤❤
4372,you cannot be serious 😭
3814,Thanks for coming back
3628,Sending love 💕 I haven’t stopped thinking about you
9570,"it feels weird not watching you almost everyday, it was something i always did- but i really hope you’re okay"
8871,I am a silent viewer and I just want to let you know that i have been logging on everyday to check if you have posted and i love you so much. I have made a mistake (as has everyone on the planet) so this doesn't change a single thing i think about you. All these lovely comments are people who care and support you <3
8001,"I hope we start to impose clear guidelines for influencers to protect them, and fans, from this in the future. Colleen and Jenna marbles... good souls and entertainers who grew up in the social media spotlight and were persecuted for their pasts. We sure do blur boundaries when influencers share their lives with us. Suddenly nothing is off-limits to fans."
54,thank you so much you are so brave
4084,I SAW IT ON TIKTOK I CANT BELIEVE ITS REAL
8816,I love you so much Colleen I don’t believe these rumors and I can’t believe people are being so rude to such a kind person like you❤
2667,"oh god, I’m watching a dumpster fire"
6101,"I've been away from social media for a while, what happened exactly? I'm so confused..."
5426,Hang in there. Focus on you and your family.  You know what you need to work on as a person and that’s what matters. Not one person is perfect and the fact that they are all standing on a soap box acting like they are is ridiculous.
460,Slayy
6516,I have been subscribed for 10 years… Im unsubscribing
6841,❤
4191,what the fuck is this aaaaaa 🤣🤣🤣
7225,it was bad for her.... it was really bad for her... and yes i was liking all the shady posts!
625,Best apology I’ve seen
3699,Ain't no way
9412,We love you Colleen!!! I hope you’re ok! I hope these meany people go away
390,KEEP YOUR HEAD UP ❤YOUR DOING A GREAT JOB ❤
6801,I can't believe they're going on and trashing you for what past I don't believe everything I hear on YouTube
9830,First comment.
6245,NOT THE UKULELE ☠️
8603,"Sorry you have been hurt so badly, attacked and broken. Missed watching your videos...stay strong, you still have fans here for you"
5833,"You really woke up and thought this was a good idea, huh"
1467,this is not real LMFAOOOOO
2898,"10 minutes gone by, no ""sorry"" detected"
7554,cancel culture is horrible. your true supporters know you and your heart and we love you. <3
9910,👀👀👀👀
9555,"not even 4 minutes in, but she’s a lyrical genius."
4582,what the fuck LMAOOO
9543,We love and missed you Colleen!
8525,"This is a perfect response. The internet is so extremist. You fucked up, you know that, you’ve suffered consequences because of that.. done."
8166,❤
2919,There's literally proof lol people are not making up rumors. You've behaved totally inappropriately towards underage fans. Time to throw in the towel and get a normal 9-5 job.
8067,The fact that this got almost 7k likes that means probably 7k people agree with her and stand with her
8880,Stay strong! I miss you !!!
5196,"Some ideas should stay like that, ideas. This ain't it... It isn't too late to private the video tho"
1010,omg this feels like the gabbi hanna thing all over again
7672,i love you. please don’t forget so many of us do and will support you forever.
7011,"Please don’t stop posting, sharing with us and pursuing your amazing career, Colleen. Every single human makes unintentional mistakes ALL THE TIME. You’re loved and trusted, and we need you here (as long as you want to be) ❤"
4539,GIRL WHAT IS THIS 💀
4396,what the fuck
2215,"there’s actual evidence. texts, videos, AUDIO made by ur friend cory😭"
3797,You are seriously delusional if you think this is any kind of acceptable.
656,"I mean we all gotta calm down. She chose to expose herself but no one is perfect. I really think she’s changed, people change and try to be better. We should all try and be better than yesterday, seriously who are we to judge people by their past??"
5749,How much does this woman love the sound of her own voice? Height of narcissism.
2840,Oof.
5043,I feel such a responsibility to say that I believe you Colleen and I am so sorry you are having to go trough this. This situation is not fair to you and your family and it makes me feel so disappointed with this new generation of teens and young adults relying on cancel culture and making someone else's life difficult. I appreciate the creative way to decided to stand up for yourself and I admire the strength this videos probably took for you to make ❤
3489,bro imagine if logan paul did this
86,I love you Colleen I’m sorry about this ❤
10010,first
9202,I have been so worried about you. I know you aren’t doing good but know your fans are heartbroken for you! All the hugs in the world!
2736,dawg ☠️
5880,"People saying she needs to take accountability. What will taking accountability do exactly. People need to get a life and stop being toxic to everyone. If there are victims of any crime from anyone that has ever been 'cancelled'  they should go to the police if they think something really wrong has happened to them, or have had a crime committed against them. That's how people are held accountable. The mob baying for blood does not improve anyone's lives. The mob is not better than anyone."
9780,Hold Ur head up queen
2670,"Hey Colleen<br> I just wanted to let you know that as soon as I heard the rumours I acknowledged it was likely you made a mistake in the past (as you said people make mistakes) BUT I immediately decided based on the information out there and how you seem to live your life now (not that anyone really knows (which is part of the reason I feel like maybe they shouldn’t be so quick to judge…. Annnyway)) that you seem like you’ve grown and moved on. Even if it was an unfortunate mistake that seemed to hurt people, if you choose to lean and grow and change the way you behave, in my personal opinion that’s enough to show you actually are remorseful of your behaviour and there is tons of room for forgiveness. Anyway just wanted to sound off for the people who didn’t jump on the train cuz they see a genuine caring woman in you and we’re standing with you the whole time 👍"
2487,"y’all she never said this was an apology video… she is sticking up for herself. sure she made some mistakes, but that was a few years ago, it was addressed, she apologized, it should’ve been over. now it’s being brought up again, and i definitely think this time it’s for clout. let her live her life."
4627,You’re delusional.
6185,We support you!! Stay Strong!!
1864,"If you were really ""apologizing"" then you’d put this on your main channel, not your vlog channel 😂"
845,Colleen you still have people that love you! Please know that! ❤
6793,WHAT THE HELL🔥 Creepy.
2965,"maybe don’t deny everything and move on, maybe talk about why they aren’t true. maybe we believe it because we haven’t heard any other reason, even now!!"
961,oh she’s done done now fr fr
889,Gabbie Hanna is that you?
7950,"Colleen we've never met in person but I got to know you through your videos and I consider you a friend. I just wanted to tell you that I am sorry for the why you've been treated recently. You don't deserve it. I know that it must be hard for you right now but please remember that there are a lot of people who care about you. I will be here once you are ready to go back to making videos, as I am sure a lot of other people will ❤"
1121,I don’t like how she victimizes herself the whole song
2559,"Literally what is wrong with you you only care about yourself, these poor kids"
